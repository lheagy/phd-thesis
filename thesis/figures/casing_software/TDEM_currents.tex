\caption{
    Current density for a time domain experiment where one electrode is connected to the top of the casing and a return electrode is on the surface, 1000 m away.
    Six different times are shown, corresponding to each of the six rows; the times are indicated in the plots in panel (d).
    Panel (a) shows a zoomed-in cross section of the current density in the immediate vicinity of the steel cased well.
    Panel (b) shows a cross section through the half-space along the same line as the source wire.
    Panels (c) and (d) show depth-slices of the currents at 54 m and 801 m depth.
