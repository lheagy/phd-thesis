    Electrode locations to be compared. The top casing electrode (blue),
    centered electrode (green, 500m depth), and downhole electrode (red, 500m depth)
    are connected to the casing. The surface electrode (orange) is offset from the well
    by 0.1m. The remaining electrodes are positioned along the axis of the casing. Panel (a)
    shows the entire length of the casing, while (b) zooms in to the bottom of the casing
    to show the separation between the electrodes beneath the casing.
