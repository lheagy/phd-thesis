    Cross section showing: (a) electrical conductivity, (b) current density, (c) charge density, and
    (d) electric field for a DC resistivity experiment with a conductive target (top) and a resistive target
    (bottom). The positive electrode is positioned at 912.5 m depth.
    No casing is included in this simulation. Note that the colorbars for the charge density (c) and electric field (d)
    are different than those used in Figure \ref{fig:target_physics}. For the resistive target, the colorbar is saturated,
    the charge density over the resistive target is on the order of $10^{-13}$ C/m$^3$.
