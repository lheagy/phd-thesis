    Three realizations of a 2km long casing in a layered background, where the conductivity of the
    layers is assigned randomly. Each layer is 50m thick, and the mean conductivity of the background
    is 0.1 S/m. The color of the title corresponds to the plots of the currents and charges in Figure
    \ref{fig:approximating_wells_currents_charges_random}
