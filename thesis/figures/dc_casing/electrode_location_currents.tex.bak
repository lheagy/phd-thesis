    Total current density along a vertical line offset (a) 25m, (b) 50m and (c) 100m
    from the axis of the casing, which extends
    from the surface (0m) to 1000m depth.
    The electrode locations correspond to those shown in Figure \ref{fig:electrode_location}.
    For reference, a simulation with an electrode 20m below the casing when there is no casing present
    is shown in black.
