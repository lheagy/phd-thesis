    (a) Sum of the primary and secondary radial electric field due to a dipolar
    target with moment of 38 Am
    centered 50m from the well, either calculated with the
    casing (blue) or simply a dipole in a half-space (orange). (b) Secondary
    radial electric field due to a dipolar target in a halfspace with casing (blue) and without casing (orange).
    Secondary radial electric field as a percentage of the primary.
    The target is along a line $90^\circ$ from the
    source electrodes; this is the same line along which we measure data at the surface.
