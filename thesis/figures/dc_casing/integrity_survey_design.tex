\caption{
    (a) Primary electric field at the surface due.
    The positive electrode is connected to the intact,
    1000 m long casing and a return electrode is at $x=$-250 m. The white dotted
    line is $90^\circ$ from the source and is the line along which radial electric field
    data are collected.
    (b) Secondary radial electric field along a line $90^{\circ}$ from the source line (white dotted line in (a))
    due to a flaw at 500 m depth. Each line color indicates a different return electrode offset.
    (c) Secondary radial electric field as a percentage of the primary.
