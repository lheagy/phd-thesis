abstract = {Simulating direct current resistivity, frequency domain electromagnetics and time domain electromagnetics in settings where steel cased boreholes are present is of interest across a range of applications including well-logging, monitoring subsurface injections such as hydraulic fracturing or carbon capture and storage. In some surveys, well-casings have been used as `extended electrodes' for near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased well is in a modeling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging. Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modeling electromagnetic problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization. The associated software implementation includes modeling capabilities for direct current resistivity, time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes, and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated. We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and fluxes through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on direct current resistivity and electromagnetics in steel-cased wells. The software implementation is open source and included as a part of the SimPEG software ecosystem for simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics.},

abstract = {Computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. Researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. We present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. In the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on GitHub, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. In a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. In a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks per-sonal, exploratory, and messy. Importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. These studies demon-strate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. We conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.},

abstract = {The dispersion and absorption of a considerable number of liquid and dielectrics are represented by the empirical formula$\epsilon$*−$\epsilon$∞=($\epsilon$0−$\epsilon$∞)/[1+(i$\omega$$\tau$0)1−$\alpha$]. In this equation, $\epsilon$* is the complex dielectric constant, $\epsilon$0 and $\epsilon$∞ are the ``static'' and ``infinite frequency'' dielectric constants, $\omega$=2$\pi$ times the frequency, and $\tau$0 is a generalized relaxation time. The parameter $\alpha$ can assume values between 0 and 1, the former value giving the result of Debye for polar dielectrics. The expression (1) requires that the locus of the dielectric constant in the complex plane be a circular arc with end points on the axis of reals and center below this axis. If a distribution of relaxation times is assumed to account for Eq. (1), it is possible to calculate the necessary distribution function by the method of Fuoss and Kirkwood. It is, however, difficult to understand the physical significance of this formal result. If a dielectric satisfying Eq. (1) is represented by a three‐element electrical circuit, the mechanism responsible for the dispersion is equivalent to a complex impedance with a phase angle which is independent of the frequency. On this basis, the mechanism of interaction has the striking property that energy is conserved or ``stored'' in addition to being dissipated and that the ratio of the average energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle is independent of the frequency.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic methods that utilize controlled sources have been applied for natural resource exploration for more than a century. Nevertheless, concomitant with the recent adoption of marine controlled-source electromagnetics (CSEM) by the hydrocarbon industry, the overall usefulness of CSEM methods on land has been questioned within the industry. Truly, there are few published examples of land CSEM surveys carried out completely analogously to the current marine CSEM standard approach of towing a bipole source across an array of stationary receivers, continuously transmitting a low-frequency signal and interpreting the data in the frequency domain. Rather, different sensitivity properties of different exploration targets in diverse geological settings, gradual advances in theoretical understanding, acquisition and computer technology, and different schools in different parts of the world have resulted in a sometimes confusing multitude of land-based controlled-source EM surveying approaches. Here, I aim to review previous and present-day approaches, and provide reasoning for their diversity. I focus on surface-based techniques while excluding airborne EM and well logging and on applications for hydrocarbon exploration. Attempts at the very demanding task of using onshore controlled-source EM for reservoir monitoring are shown, and the possible future potential of EM monitoring is discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Resolution and measurement diversity are important parameters that help characterize the subsurface and help optimize reservoir management. While traditional well log data provide a variety of high-resolution measurements of the formation very close to the wellbore, surface-based methods provide larger investigation volume but coarser resolution. Crosswell measurements help to bridge the gap by imaging the inter-well space at reservoir scale. Crosswell seismic data provide high resolution reflection images of reservoir architecture with resolution that is up to 10 times better than that of surface seismic data. Crosswell Electromagnetics (EM) expands the scale investigated by traditional resistivity logging to deliver, a more extensive understanding of fluid distribution and movement at reservoir scale, away from the wells. Not only do these techniques complement each other, but integrating the measured data with conventional logs and surface data into the modeling workflow gives new insight into reservoir structure and fluid movement in the formation. Recent surveys in various improved recovery projects show that these complementary measurements provide a new way to help subsurface teams accurately image geology and map injection fronts. Introduction Crosswell measurements are emerging as key reservoir characterization and monitoring tools that enable greater understanding of reservoir heterogeneity and fluid front monitoring over time. Figure 1 shows the schematic measurement gap that these measurements and integration help to bridge. Geologic heterogeneity and complexity of reservoir behavior when subjected to improved recovery processes, makes crosswell surveillance useful in constraining up-scaling techniques during static modeling and providing better predictability of injection performance. Descriptions of the crosswell seismic and electromagnetic techniques are provided below. The two case studies in this paper describe early applications of crosswell surveys in the United States in the Chevron-operated Cymric Field in California's San Joaquin Valley (Meyer et al., 2002, Morea et al., 2010) with the focus on practical applications of the technology steam floods elsewhere. In addition, the discussion focuses on the diagnostic capabilities of using crosswell seismic and electromagnetics and their sensitivity to steam injection processes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper presents the results from a research project focusing on permanent cross-well geophysical methods for reservoir monitoring during steam-assisted gravity drainage. A feasibility study indicated detectable differences in seismic and electrical reservoir properties based on expected changes in temperature and fluid saturation during the production of extra heavy oil. As a result of this, a permanent cross-well system was installed at the Leismer Demonstration Area, located in the Athabasca Oil Sands region in Alberta, Canada. Baseline data sets, including cross-well seismic, three-dimensional vertical seismic profiling and cross-well electrical resistivity tomography, have been acquired. Comparisons between conventional surface seismic and downhole seismic data show an increase in resolution and frequency content as expected. Steam-assisted gravity drainage-induced time-lapse effects are clearly visible in the 3D vertical seismic profiling and electrical resistivity tomography data sets, even after a few months of oil production. In general, the 3D vertical seismic profiling images show a higher resolution than the surface seismic data, in particular when dealing with vertical positioning of the time-lapse events. The electrical resistivity tomography baseline shows clear separation between zones of high and low electrical resistivity, and during 23 months of electrical resistivity tomography measurements the maximum reduction of resistivity is 85{\%}. Time-lapse observations from acoustic and electrical borehole data correspond well, and are also supported by temperature measurements in the two observation wells. Emerging technologies, updated models, improved flexibility, and reduced costs will allow future reservoir monitoring with surface and borehole data in combination, or even with borehole data exclusively.

abstract = {Two important mechanisms affect our ability to estimate solute concentrations quantitatively from the inversion of field-scale electrical resistivity tomography ERT data: 1 the spatially variable physical processes that govern the flow of current as well as the variation of physical proper- ties in space and 2 the overparameterization of inverse models, which requires the imposition of a smoothing con- straint regularization to facilitate convergence of the in- verse solution. Based on analyses of field and synthetic data, we find that the ability of ERT to recover the 3D shape and magnitudes of a migrating conductive target is spatially variable. Additionally, the application of Archie's law to to- mograms from field ERT data produced solute concentra- tions that are consistently less than 10{\%} of point measure- ments collected in the field and estimated from transport modeling. Estimates of concentration from ERT using Ar- chie's law only fit measured solute concentrations if the ap- parent formation factor is varied with space and time and al- lowed to take on unreasonably high values. Our analysis suggests that the inability to find a single petrophysical rela- tion in space and time between concentration and electrical resistivity is largely an effect of two properties of ERT sur- veys: 1 decreased sensitivity of ERT to detect the target plume with increasing distance from the electrodes and 2 the smoothing imprint of regularization used in inversion.},

abstract = {A saline tracer test has been performed at an industrial site, located in the Po River delta region (North-Eastern Italy). This tracer test was aimed at identifying possible hydraulic connections between a shallow unconfined aquifer and a deeper confined aquifer. Hydraulic head difference between the two aquifers is maintained via an active hydraulic barrier (pumping wells) screened in the deeper formation. The movement of the tracer in the subsurface has been monitored via electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) from the surface, using a network of twelve 48-electrode lines, for a total time period of about 45 days. This non-invasive geophysical method offers several advantages over direct water sampling from monitoring boreholes: (a) a wide area is investigated in a relatively short time; (b) a 2D picture of the subsurface is produced, in this case to a depth of about 15-20 m; (c) because of the above, it is possible to follow the tracer motion even if the tracer does not reach the few boreholes where water can be sampled. The latter is a major advantage over traditional methods, where it is not uncommon to miss the tracer plume altogether, or sample it only partially. The site is characterized by fairly saline groundwater, and the presence of diffuse silt and clay, that make the system rather conductive. Under such unfavourable conditions, careful inversion of resistance ratios was needed to identify changes in resistivity of as much as 50{\%} with respect to background. The migration of the tracer was successfully monitored and confirmed by direct sampling of water from few boreholes. The results of the time lapse survey confirm that the system is very heterogeneous, and that some downward migration of the tracer through the confining layer can take place over relatively short time periods, maybe through some manmade connections. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We assess the usefulness of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in imaging and characterising subsurface solute transport in heterogeneous unconfined aquifers. A field tracer experiment was conducted at the Krauthausen test site, Germany. The spatial and temporal evolution of the injected NaBr solute plume was monitored in a 2D ERT image plane located downstream of the injection well for 90 days. Since ERT maps changes in bulk electrical conductivity, the reconstructed images at selected time intervals are first converted to solute concentration maps by postulating a linear relation. The concentration maps are then analysed using an equivalent convection-dispersion model (CDM), which conceptualises the aquifer as a homogeneous medium with a uniform mean flow velocity. As demonstrated by associated synthetic model studies, ERT resolution in terms of recovered equivalent dispersivities is limited due to spatial smoothing inherent to the imaging algorithm. Since for heterogeneous media, local concentrations within the plume deviate from those predicted by the equivalent CDM, we also interpret the ERT-derived pixel breakthrough curves in terms of an equivalent stream-tube model (STM). The STM represents transport in the aquifer by a set of 1D convection-dispersion processes, allowing the degree of mixing and the heterogeneity of transport within the plume to be quantified. We believe that the observed tracer plume is satisfactorily described by the equivalent CDM, probably because the tracer plume was small relative to the heterogeneity scale of the aquifer. Even though application of the STM revealed some deviation from the ideal homogeneous case, the equivalent dispersivity in the STM matches the longitudinal dispersivity of the CDM closely, consistent with predominantly homogeneous mixing. However, the STM analysis illustrates how ERT results can be used to quantify the variability of parameters relevant to flow and transport in heterogeneous aquifers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Cross-borehole geoelectrical imaging, in particular electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and transmission radar tomography, can provide high-resolution images of hydrogeological structures and, in some cases, detailed assessment of dynamic processes in the subsurface environment. Through appropriate petrophysical relationships, these tools offer data suitable for parameterising and constraining models of groundwater flow. This is demonstrated using cross-borehole radar and resistivity measurements collected during a controlled vadose zone tracer test, performed at a field site in the UK Sherwood Sandstone. Both methods show clearly the vertical migration of the tracer over a 200 h monitoring period. By comparing first and second spatial moments of changes in moisture content predicted from a numerical simulation of vadose zone flow with equivalent statistics from two- and three-dimensional ERT and cross-borehole radar profiles the effective hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be approximately 0.4 m/d. Such a value is comparable to field estimates from borehole hydraulic tests carried out in the saturated zone at the field site and provides valuable information that may be utilised to parameterise pollutant transport models of the site. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Themovementof a smallplumeof fresh water through the vadose zone was monitored using surface resistiv- ity tomography and pole-pole potential measurements. Sets of potential measurements on a square grid at sev- eral times throughout the experiment show gradual, pro- gressive, and systematic development of low-resistivity zones that are inferred to be loci of fluid concentration. A procedure for inverting percentage changes in po- tentials is developed here and used to map maximum potential changes of 13{\%} into resistivity decreases of up to 40{\%} through 3-D resistivity inversion. The re- sulting patterns are complex, with both resistivity in- creases and decreases needed to match the observed data. The resistivity reductions show a spatial connec- tion to the plume's source and are suggestive of thefluid migration. Resistivity increases generally appear to form rims surrounding the decreases and may be artifacts of the inversion process. However, some iso- lated increases in the surface layer may be caused by evaporation of fluid from previous precipitation events. Interpretation of the complex patterns may limit the usefulness of this method for monitoring fluid migra- tion. Nonetheless, the resulting pattern of resistivity re- ductions may show details of fluid migration that are unavailable with more conventional monitoring tech- niques. In this experiment, comparison of the volume with reduced resistivity with the volume of injected wa- ter predicts only a 0.5{\%} increase in saturated poros- ity, demonstrating that fluid flow in the vadose zone was most likely controlled by the distribution of fine- grained clays and silts and occurred by capillary ac- tion.},

abstract = {A high resolution, cross-borehole, 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) study of solute transport was conducted in a large experimental tank. ERT voxels comprising the time sequence of electrical images were converted into a 3D array of ERT estimated fluid conductivity breakthrough curves and compared with direct measurements of fluid conductivity breakthrough made in wells. The 3D ERT images of solute transport behaviour were also compared with predictions based on a 3D finite-element, coupled flow and transport model, accounting for gravity induced flow caused by concentration differences. The tank (dimensions 185 × 245 × 186 cm) was filled with medium sand, with a gravel channel and a fine sand layer installed. This heterogeneous system was designed to complicate solute transport behaviour relative to a homogeneous sand tank, and to thus provide a challenging but insightful analysis of the ability of 3D ERT to resolve transport phenomena. Four ERT arrays and 20 piezometers were installed during filling. A NaCl tracer (conductivity 1.34 S/m) was injected and intensively monitored with 3D ERT and direct sampling of fluid chemistry in piezometers. We converted the bulk conductivity estimate for 250 voxels in the ERT imaged volume into ERT estimated voxel fluid conductivity by assuming that matrix conduction in the tank is negligible. In general, the ERT voxel response is in reasonable agreement with the shape of fluid conductivity breakthrough observed in six wells in which direct measurements of fluid conductivity were made. However, discrepancies occur, particularly at early times, which we attribute to differences between the scale of the image voxels and the fluid conductivity measurement, measurement errors mapped into the electrical inversion and artificial image roughness resulting from the inversion. ERT images revealed the 3D tracer distribution at 15 times after tracer injection. The general pattern and timing of solute breakthrough observed with ERT agreed with that predicted from the flow/transport modelling. However, the ERT images indicate a vertical component of tracer transport and preferential flow paths in the medium sand. We attribute this to transient vertical gradients established during tracer injection, and heterogeneity caused by sorting of the sand resulting from the filling procedure. In this study, ERT provided a unique dataset of 250 voxel breakthrough curves in 1.04 m3. The use of 3D ERT to generate an array of densely sampled estimated fluid conductivity breakthrough curves is a potentially powerful tool for quantifying solute transport processes. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Determining groundwater flow paths of infiltrated river water is necessary for studying biochemical processes in the riparian zone, but their characterization is complicated by strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity. We investigated to what extent repeat 3D surface electrical resistance tomography (ERT) can be used to monitor transport of a salt-tracer plume under close to natural gradient conditions. The aim is to estimate groundwater flow velocities and pathways at a site located within a riparian groundwater system adjacent to the perialpine Thur River in northeastern Switzerland. Our ERT time-lapse images provide constraints on the plume's shape, flow direction, and velocity. These images allow the movement of the plume to be followed for 35 m. Although the hydraulic gradient is only 1.43 parts per thousand, the ERT time-lapse images demonstrate that the plume's center of mass and its front propagate with velocities of 2x10(-4) m/s and 5x10(-4) m/s, respectively. These velocities are compatible with groundwater resistivity monitoring data in two observation wells 5 m from the injection well. Five additional sensors in the 5-30 m distance range did not detect the plume. Comparison of the ERT time-lapse images with a groundwater transport model and time-lapse inversions of synthetic ERT data indicate that the movement of the plume can be described for the first 6 h after injection by a uniform transport model. Subsurface heterogeneity causes a change of the plume's direction and velocity at later times. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using time-lapse 3D surface ERT to monitor flow pathways in a challenging perialpine environment over larger scales than is practically possible with crosshole 3D ERT.},

abstract = {Traditional characterization of hyporheic processes relies upon modelling observed in-stream and subsurface breakthrough curves to estimate hyporheic zone size and infer exchange rates. Solute data integrate upstream behaviour and lack spatial coverage, limiting our ability to accurately quantify spatially heterogeneous exchange dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the application of near-surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) methods, coupled with experiments using an electrically conductive stream tracer (dissolved NaCl), to provide in situ imaging of spatial and temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange. Tracer-labelled water in the stream enters the hyporheic zone, reducing electrical resistivity in the subsurface (to which subsurface ERI is sensitive). Comparison of background measurements with those recording tracer presence provides distributed characterization of hyporheic area (in this application, similar to 0.5 m(2)). Results demonstrate the first application of ERI for two-dimensional imaging of stream-aquifer exchange and hyporheic extent. Future application of this technique will greatly enhance our ability to quantify processes controlling solute transport and fate in hyporheic zones, and provide data necessary to inform more complete numerical models.

abstract = {[1] Cross-well electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to monitor the migration of a saline tracer in a two-well pumping-injection experiment conducted at the Massachusetts Military Reservation in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. After injecting 2200 mg/L of sodium chloride for 9 hours, ERT data sets were collected from four wells every 6 hours for 20 days. More than 180,000 resistance measurements were collected during the tracer test. Each ERT data set was inverted to produce a sequence of 3-D snapshot maps that track the plume. In addition to the ERT experiment a pumping test and an infiltration test were conducted to estimate horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values. Using modified moment analysis of the electrical conductivity tomograms, the mass, center of mass, and spatial variance of the imaged tracer plume were estimated. Although the tomograms provide valuable insights into field-scale tracer migration behavior and aquifer heterogeneity, standard tomographic inversion and application of Archie's law to convert electrical conductivities to solute concentration results in underestimation of tracer mass. Such underestimation is attributed to ( 1) reduced measurement sensitivity to electrical conductivity values with distance from the electrodes and ( 2) spatial smoothing ( regularization) from tomographic inversion. The center of mass estimated from the ERT inversions coincided with that given by migration of the tracer plume using 3-D advective-dispersion simulation. The 3-D plumes seen using ERT exhibit greater apparent dispersion than the simulated plumes and greater temporal spreading than observed in field data of concentration breakthrough at the pumping well.},

abstract = {Geophysical monitoring is used principally to interpret the locations and amounts of ground condition changes. To achieve these objectives, differences are computed and examined using time-lapse images calculated under the time-invariant static assumption, that any material property changes during the data measurement can be practically ignored. These monitored data, however, can be contaminated with noise and frequently generate false anomalies of ground condition changes. Furthermore, the assumption of the static model can be invalid if the material property changes significantly during data acquisition. To alleviate these problems, we developed a new least-squares inversion algorithm that allows for the subsurface properties to continuously change in time. We define the subsurface structure and the entire monitoring data in the space-time domain, allowing us to obtain a four-dimensional space-time model using just one inversion process. We introduce the regularizations not only in the space domain but also in time, resulting in reduced inversion artifacts and improved stability of the inverse problem. We demonstrated the performance of the proposed algorithm through numerical experiments that assumed several scenarios of ground condition changes and data acquisition sequences. Finally, the applicability to field data was proven by applying the developed algorithm to the monitoring data of crosshole resistivity tomography jointly performed with a dye tracer flooding experiment. This experiment had a small enough scale that we could not ignore the change of material properties during the data measurement. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Time-lapse monitoring is a powerful tool for observing dynamic changes in the subsurface. In particular it offers the potential for achieving inversion results with increased fidelity through the inclusion of complementary information from multiple time-steps. This inclusion of complementary information can reduce the need for spatial smoothing, without adding inversion artifacts to the resulting images. Commonly used time-lapse inversion methods include the ratio method, cascaded time-lapse inversion, difference inversion and differencing independent inversions. We introduce two additional methods in which both time-lapse data sets are inverted simultaneously. In the first, called temporally constrained time-lapse inversion, inversion of both datasets is done under a single optimization procedure and constraints are added to the regularization to ensure that the changes from one time to another are smooth. In the second method, called simultaneous time-lapse inversion, the inversions at time 1 and time 2 are performed simultaneously and constraints of smoothness and closeness to a reference model are applied to the difference image produced at each iteration, and subsequently, the constraints are updated at each iteration. Through both a numerical and a field example we compare the results of common time-lapse inversion methods as well as the introduced approaches. We found that of the commonly used time-lapse inversion methods the difference inversion method produced the best resolution of time-lapse changes and was the most robust in the presence of noise. However, we found that the alternative approach of simultaneous time-lapse inversion produced the best reconstruction of modeled EC changes in the numerical example and easily interpretable high resolution difference images in the field example. Moreover, there was less tailoring of regularization parameters with our simultaneous time-lapse approach, suggesting that it will lend itself well to an automated inversion code. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The spatial roughness filter constrains the model resistivity to vary smoothly in the x, y and z directions. A temporal roughness filter is also applied that minimizes changes in the resistivity between successive temporal inversion models. This method can accurately resolve temporal changes in the resistivity even in the presence of noise. The use of the L1 and L2 norm constraints for the temporal roughness filter are examined using a synthetic model. The L1 norm temporal constraint produces significantly more accurate results when the resistivity changes abruptly with time. A test with field data from a landfill site with methane gas accumulation shows near surface resistivity changes that are probably due to surface temperature variations. The temperature variations cause changes in the gas volume and moisture content in the near surface landfill materials.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.Electric resistivity tomography (ERT) is a widespread technique used for geologic and hydrological subsurface characterization. The 3D application is limited to small scales due to the enormous effort required for field surveys. Long-electrode (LE)-ERT using steel-cased boreholes can overcome small-scale limitations and has recently gained significant attention. However, no systematic investigation concerning the performance of long electrodes has been performed. We have conducted synthetic studies of LE-ERT to understand its advantages and limitations. We have compared three different approaches of modeling long electrodes, placing particular emphasis on the complete electrode model, to determine which reflects the physical reality best and thus can be used as a benchmark. The conductive cell model led to comparable results but was numerically more expensive. An interesting alternative approach was the shunt electrode model, which does not require discretizing the lateral extension of the casing. Systematic sensitivity studies revealed that model resolution could be enhanced in the borehole depth range through the use of electrodes of different lengths or surface electrodes. Varying contact impedances along different sections of the borehole can change the electric field visibly and influence four-point measurements. Even if large electrode segments show reduced coupling, the influence on voltage measurements was below 4{\%} for realistic contact impedances. We have proven the applicability of LE-ERT for imaging lateral saltwater movement through the simulation of simple scenarios in the context of saltwater intrusion. Our synthetic examples determined the advantage of long electrodes compared with simulations using surface electrodes. The 3D inversion of synthetic data sets revealed that the modeled anomalies could be imaged in most cases. Different models revealed limitations due to poor vertical resolution and supported the usage of casings with different lengths or in combination with surface electrodes to improve resolution.},

abstract = {SummaryPattern water flooding has recently been pilot tested at the Dom Joao oil field in northern Brazil to improve recovery over the earlier peripheral flooding. The conformance and sweep of the injected water has been monitored over several years using well logs and crosswell EM and the small pilot features fiberglass cased injection wells which are also used for well based and crosswell monitoring using inductive measurements. Baseline crosswell EM data were collected in 2008, prior to initiation of water flooding in 2009. Time lapse crosswell EM and induction logging data collected in 2011 were used to image the water saturation changes between wells.After 2.5 years of flooding, repeated logs indicate that the resistivity has decreased from 12-15 ohm-m to 6-8 ohm-m in some intervals and less in others; this is less than half of the expected change and it is likely due to poor conformance. Tracking this small formation resistivity anomaly has proved challenging for the crosswell EM program, requiring high accuracy data collection and precision tool positioning to recover the 3{\%}-5{\%} field anomalies. Fortunately, benign field conditions and a newly developed field system have provided two remarkable data sets in which the data in non-flooded (i.e. shale) intervals repeat to 1{\%} or less and the small anomalies recovered are imaged with some confidence.The crosswell results have provided an image consistent with the logs showing a low resistivity plume around each injector. The plume typically progresses 50-70m from each injector, and mainly in the upper parts of the reservoir. This suggests that the flooding is progressing slowly and that much of the injected water is traveling to producers in already swept intervals.},

abstract = {Novotny, E.J., Member of SPE-AIME, Exxon Production Research Co. Abstract A method is presented for predicting: 1) the transport of proppant in a vertical fracture during a hydraulic fracturing treatment, 2) the settling of the proppant during closure of the fracture following the treatment, and 3) from the final distribution of proppant, the increase in well productivity that results from the treatment. The examples given illustrate that proppant settling during fracture closure can be important in the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment. Field data illustrate the time required for fracture closure. The computer program which models the fracturing process uses proppant settling velocities obtained from extensive laboratory data collected under simulated fracturing conditions. Proppant settling predictions include the effects of non-Newtonian fluids, concentrated slurries of proppant, fracture walls, and changes in fluid temperatures along the fracture. These substantially affect the settling velocity of the proppant and must be considered to obtain a realistic prediction of proppant transport. Introduction In hydraulic fracturing, fluid is injected into a well at a high enough rate and pressure to crack open the productive formation. when the fracture is estimated to be sufficiently wide and long, sand or some suitable propping material is injected along with additional fluid. The function of the proppant is to keep the fracture open after injection stops. The amount of production increase, or stimulation, from a hydraulic fracturing treatment depends on the conductivity and final distribution of proppant in the fracture. While proppant is injected into the fracture, it travels along with the fluid away from the wellbore and settles downward at a rate that depends on the fluid properties and surrounding conditions. When the treatment is over, the fracture closes as fracturing fluid is lost through the permeable walls of the fracture. while this is happening, the proppant continues to settle until: 1) the proppant forms a bank at the bottom of the fracture, 2) the proppant concentration in the slurry becomes so high that it can no longer settle, or 3) the fracture closes on the slurry, trapping the proppant. Pressure measurements following a treatment have indicated fracture closure in the field. Sometimes the rate of closure can determine the success or failure of the treatment. Until now, however, fracture closure has not been realistically considered in treatment design. The prediction of proppant transport is intricate, because as the slurry travels from the wellbore, several things occur: The proppant and fluid are heated and the formation rock is cooled. Because fluid is continuously lost to the reservoir, the proppant concentration increases and the fluid velocity decreases. The width of the fracture decreases away from the wellbore, which alters the fluid velocity. These and other factors that affect the settling velocity of the proppant and its velocity along the fracture are too numerous and complex to model adequately unless numerical computational techniques are used. Previous research that modeled the transport of proppant while fracturing did not model fracture closure. This paper presents a method that models the entire fracturing process, including closure. The equations for proppant settling are developed theoretically and verified experimentally. Most stimulation predictive methods assume a rectangular fracture, but in the method presented here the fracture permeability, width, and effective height can vary with fracture length. The following section discusses the importance of accurate proppant transport predictions for optimum treatment design, emphasizing fracture closure. Details of the computer model, theory, and experimental work will then be presented. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Four computer-simulated example treatments are used to illustrate the importance of accurate proppant transport predictions, including the effect of fracture closure.},

abstract = {— Hydraulic fracturing is a technique to fracture rocks by pumping high-pressure fluid into a segment of a well. The created fractures help to release a hydrocarbon resource such as oil or natural gas from the rock. A group of small-scaled fracturing field tests are performed by the Advanced Energy Consortium to investigate the feasibility of using the galvanic elec-tromagnetic (EM) method to map fractures. The injected prop-pants are designed with high EM contrasts (e.g., conductivity and permittivity) to generate detectable signals at electrode-type sen-sors. To map the created fractures, an efficient 3-D EM inversion method is introduced to simultaneously reconstruct conductivity and permittivity profiles in fractures. First, to test the capability of the inversion solver and the designed experimental setting for successful fracture mapping, the noise-polluted synthetic data are used to reconstruct the fracture on a theoretical model. It shows that the designed experimental setting can be used to map the fracture and the inversion solver is able to reconstruct the frac-ture in both conductivity and permittivity. The inversion method is then applied to two hydraulic fracturing field tests with injected high-contrast proppants, Loresco coke breeze and steel shot. The fracture conductivity and permittivity are reconstructed based on the voltage signals difference between the postfracturing and prefracturing data. The reconstructed fracture profiles are compared with the coring samplings to show the reliability of the inversion results. Their good agreement demonstrates that the experimental setting and the galvanic inverse solver are able to estimate the fracture size and location reliably.

The properties of the final composite depend upon the construction path taken and not just on the final volume fractions.

The present method includes as special cases of paths or endpoints the differential scheme of Roscoe-Boucher and the self-consistent scheme of Kroner-Hill, respectively.

abstract = {We propose a method that may be used to determine the spatial orientation of the fracture plane developed during hydraulic fracture. In the method, magnetic particles are injected into the crack with the fracturing fluid so as to generate a sheet of magnetized material. Since the magnetization of a body with extreme dimension ratios, such as a crack, exceeds that of an equidimensional body and since this magnetization is sensitive both to orientation and geometry, this could be used to obtain information about the crack. By measuring the vertical and horizontal components of the magnetic field and field gradients at the earth''s surface surrounding the injection well with superconducting magnetometers having 10–4 gamma sensitivity and also by measuring field direction within the well itself, it should be possible to calculate the orientation and perhaps infer the approximate geometry of the fracture surface. Experiments on electric field potential operated in conjunction with this experiment could further constrain estimates of shape and orientation.},

Due to depths exceeding 4050 m, bottom hole temperatures exceeding 140 °C, and open hole section (dual zone), technically demanding and somewhat unprecedented conditions had to be managed. The fracturing operations were successful. Fractures were created in two isolated borehole intervals and the inflow behaviour of the reservoir was decisively enhanced. The effective pressures applied for fracture initiation and propagation were only slightly above in situ pore pressures. Nevertheless, the stimulation ratio predicted by fracture performance modelling could not be achieved. Multiple reasons could be identified that account for the mismatch. An insufficient fracture tie-back, as well as chemical and mechanical processes during closure, led to reduced fracture conductivities and therefore diminished productivity. The insights gained are the basis for further fracture design concepts at the given and geologic comparable sites. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In some surveys, well-casings have been used as "extended electrodes" for near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased well is in a modelling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging. Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modelling electromagnetic problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization. The associated software implementation includes modelling capabilities for direct current resistivity, time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated. We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and fluxes through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on DC and electromagnetics in steel-cased wells. The software implementation is open source and included as a part of the SimPEG software ecosystem for simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges and unknowns during shale gas exploration is to assess the range and efficiency of hydraulic fracturing. It is also essential to assess the distribution of proppant, which keeps the fracture pathways open. Solving these problems may considerably increase the efficiency of the shale gas extraction. Because of that, the idea of smart magnetic marker, which can be detected when added to fracturing fluid, has been considered for a long time. This study provides overview of the possibilities of magnetic marker application for shale gas extraction. The imaging methods using electromagnetic markers, are considered or developed in two directions. The first possibility is the markers' electromagnetic activity throughout the whole volume of the fracturing fluid. Thus, it can be assumed that the whole fracturing fluid is the marker. Among these type of hydraulic fracturing solutions, ferrofluid could be considered. The second possibility is marker, which is just one of many components of the fracturing fluid. In this case feedstock magnetic materials, ferrites and nanomaterials could be considered. Magnetic properties of magnetite could be too low and ferrofluids' or nanomaterials' price is unacceptably high. Because of that, ferrites, especially ZnMn ferrites seems to be the best material for magnetic marker. Because of the numerous applications in electronics, it is cheap and easily available, although the price is higher, then that of magnetite. The disadvantage of using ferrite, could be too small mechanical strength. It creates an essential need for combining magnetic marker with proppant into magnetic-ceramic composite.},

abstract = {We compare the sensitivity of magnetic field measurements to perturbations of magnetic permeability with the field sensitivity to conductivity alterations. The conductivity perturbations can be caused by the different conductivity of the injected and formation resident fluid and the magnetic permeability perturbations by injecting magnetic nanoparticles. We devise a simple method for calculating the magnetic permeability sensitivity required to solve parametric inverse problems in electromagnetic (EM) tomography involving magnetic permeability perturbations. We apply the method in 3D and 2D axisymmetric to both crosswell and single-well configurations in a homogeneous background. The emphasis of this paper is on measurements acquired at very low induction numbers (kr. ≪. 1; k being the wave number and r the distance) where the wave length or the skin depth becomes an irrelevant scale.The sensitivity to magnetic permeability perturbations is significantly higher than conductivity perturbations at low frequencies. Furthermore, at the low-frequency regime, the magnetic permeability sensitivity is largely independent of frequency, unlike the conductivity sensitivity which improves with frequency, consistent with quasi-static dipole magnetics. The sensitivity patterns for conductivity and magnetic permeability are quite different. The four lobes with opposite signs surrounding the source and receiver in case of magnetic permeability provide opportunities for vertical discrimination of magnetic measurements. In the case of a single-well configuration, the sensitivity to magnetic permeability perturbation is larger close to the wellbore than conductivity. Also, the sign reversals of both real and imaginary parts of the magnetic permeability enhance the horizontal sensitivity of the magnetic measurements.The geometry of the problem also affects the sensitivities quite significantly. Both 3D and 2D axisymmetric are considered in this study. The geometrical spreading of the perturbed region in the axisymmetric case suppresses the sensitivity value for both conductivity and magnetic permeability.The magnetic permeability perturbations exhibit a higher sensitivity when the magnetic contrast agents are in the proximity of the source and receivers (or near the wellbore in case of single-well). On the other hand, EM measurements are more sensitive to conductivity perturbations in the interwell region in the case of a crosswell and off-wellbore in the case of a single-well system at moderate and high frequencies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ultralow-permeability shale reservoirs require a large fracture network to maximize well performance. Microseismic fracture mapping has shown that large fracture networks can be generated in many shale reservoirs. In conventional reservoirs and tight gas sands, single-plane-fracture half-length and conductivity are the key drivers for stimulation performance. In shale reservoirs, where complex network structures in multiple planes are created, the concepts of single-fracture half-length and conductivity are insufficient to describe stimulation performance. This is the reason for the concept of using stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) as a correlation parameter for well performance. The size of the created fracture network can be approximated as the 3D volume (stimulated reservoir volume) of the microseismic-event cloud. This paper briefly illustrates how the SRV can be estimated from microseismic-mapping data and is then related to total injected-fluid volume and well performance. While the effectively producing network could be smaller by some proportion, it is assumed that the created and the effective network are directly related. However, SRV is not the only driver of well performance. Fracture spacing and conductivity within a given SRV are just as important, and this paper illustrates how both SRV and fracture spacing for a given conductivity can affect production acceleration and ultimate recovery. The effect of fracture conductivity is discussed separately in a series of companion papers. Simulated-production data are then compared with actual field results to demonstrate variability in well performance and how this concept can be used to improve completion design, well spacing, and placement strategies.},

abstract = {In order to reduce the computational cost of the simulation of electromagnetic responses in geophysical settings that involve highly heterogeneous media, we develop a multiscale finite volume method with oversampling for the quasi-static Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. We assume a coarse mesh nested within a fine mesh that accurately discretizes the problem. For each coarse cell, we independently solve a local version of the original Maxwell's system subject to linear boundary conditions on an extended domain, which includes the coarse cell and a neighborhood of fine cells around it. The local Maxwell's system is solved using the fine mesh contained in the extended domain and the mimetic finite volume method. Next, these local solutions (basis functions) together with a weak-continuity condition are used to construct a coarse-mesh version of the global problem. The basis functions can be used to obtain the fine-mesh details from the solution of the coarse-mesh problem. Our approach leads to a significant reduction in the size of the final system of equations and the computational time, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a synthetic 3D example of a mineral deposit.},

@article{Cockett2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd Fluid flow in the vadose zone is governed by the Richards equation; it is parameterized by hydraulic conductivity, which is a nonlinear function of pressure head. Investigations in the vadose zone typically require characterizing distributed hydraulic properties. Water content or pressure head data may include direct measurements made from boreholes. Increasingly, proxy measurements from hydrogeophysics are being used to supply more spatially and temporally dense data sets. Inferring hydraulic parameters from such datasets requires the ability to efficiently solve and optimize the nonlinear time domain Richards equation. This is particularly important as the number of parameters to be estimated in a vadose zone inversion continues to grow. In this paper, we describe an efficient technique to invert for distributed hydraulic properties in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Our technique does not store the Jacobian matrix, but rather computes its product with a vector. Existing literature for the Richards equation inversion explicitly calculates the sensitivity matrix using finite difference or automatic differentiation, however, for large scale problems these methods are constrained by computation and/or memory. Using an implicit sensitivity algorithm enables large scale inversion problems for any distributed hydraulic parameters in the Richards equation to become tractable on modest computational resourc es. We provide an open source implementation of our technique based on the SimPEG framework, and show it in practice for a 3D inversion of saturated hydraulic conductivity using water content data through time.},

abstract = {Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are transforming energy production, but their potential environmental effects remain controversial.

Methane was detected in 82{\%} of drinking water samples, with average concentrations six times higher for homes {\textless}1 km from natural gas wells (P = 0.0006). Ethane was 23 times higher in homes {\textless}1 km from gas wells (P = 0.0013); propane was detected in 10 water wells, all within approximately 1 km distance (P = 0.01). Of three factors previously proposed to influence gas concentrations in shallow groundwater (distances to gas wells, valley bottoms, and the Appalachian Structural Front, a proxy for tectonic deformation), distance to gas wells was highly significant for methane concentrations (P = 0.007; multiple regression), whereas distances to valley bottoms and the Appalachian Structural Front were not significant (P = 0.27 and P = 0.11, respectively). Distance to gas wells was also the most significant factor for Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses (P {\textless} 0.01). For ethane concentrations, distance to gas wells was the only statistically significant factor (P {\textless} 0.005). Isotopic signatures ($\delta$13C-CH4, $\delta$13C-C2H6, and $\delta$2H-CH4), hydrocarbon ratios (methane to ethane and propane), and the ratio of the noble gas 4He to CH4 in groundwater were characteristic of a thermally postmature Marcellus-like source in some cases. Overall, our data suggest that some homeowners living {\textless}1 km from gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases.},

abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH(4) L(-1) (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$(2)H-CH(4) values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and-possibly-regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

abstract = {A new logging method, called induction logging, is described; it measures the conductivity, or resistivity, of the strata traversed by a bore hole. The apparatus, which is briefly described, comprises a coil system coupled with the ground by induction, so that there is no need for direct contact with the mud, or with the formations. For that reason, the method is particularly useful in oil base mud, and it was first applied to that case.$\backslash$nA discussion concerning the respective contribution of each region of ground in the vicinity of the coil system is given. Through the concept of a geometrical factor, it is demonstrated that the total signal, which measures the apparent conductivity, is the summation of the partia1 products - geometrical factor by conductivity - for the different regions of the ground under consideration. It is thus possible to establish, for each type of coil arangement, investigation characteristic as well as departure curves and correction charts for beds of various thicknesses. This should greatly facilitate the quantative interpretation of the field logs, even in cases where such interpretation would have been difficult on electric logs taken with electrodes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIt is also shown that focussing combinations of coils can be used, which give, directly on the recorded log, a value close to the true conductivity, even for fairly thin beds, thus eliminating in most cases the need for corrections. These focussing systems also give a sharper definition of the boundaries between successive strata.},

abstract = {Casing and cement impairment in oil and gas wells can lead to methane migration into the atmosphere and/or into underground sources of drinking water. An analysis of 75,505 compliance reports for 41,381 conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania drilled from January 1, 2000-December 31, 2012, was performed with the objective of determining complete and accurate statistics of casing and cement impairment. Statewide data show a sixfold higher incidence of cement and/or casing issues for shale gas wells relative to conventional wells. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate risk of impairment based on existing data. The model identified both temporal and geographic differences in risk. For post-2009 drilled wells, risk of a cement/casing impairment is 1.57-fold [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) (1.45, 1.67); P {\textless} 0.0001] higher in an unconventional gas well relative to a conventional well drilled within the same time period. Temporal differences between well types were also observed and may reflect more thorough inspections and greater emphasis on finding well leaks, more detailed note taking in the available inspection reports, or real changes in rates of structural integrity loss due to rushed development or other unknown factors. Unconventional gas wells in northeastern (NE) Pennsylvania are at a 2.7-fold higher risk relative to the conventional wells in the same area. The predicted cumulative risk for all wells (unconventional and conventional) in the NE region is 8.5-fold [95{\%} CI (7.16, 10.18); P {\textless} 0.0001] greater than that of wells drilled in the rest of the state.},

In this methodology, the forward modeling equations are incorporated as constraints and, thus, we need to solve a constrained optimization problem where the parameters are the electromagnetic fields, the conductivity model, and a set of Lagrange multipliers. This leads to a much larger problem than the traditional unconstrained formulation where only the conductivities are sought. Nevertheless, experience shows that the constrained problem can be solved faster than the unconstrained one. The primary reasons are that the forward problem does not have to be solved exactly until the very end of the optimization process, and that permitting the fields to be away from their constrained values in the initial stages introduces flexibility so that a stationary point of the objective function is found more quickly.

This model shows that even a 5{\%} improvement in stimulated reservoir volume for a 1 billion barrel (bbl.) field results in over 1 billion U.S. dollars (US{\$}) in net present value over 24 years for US{\$}100/bbl. oil and US{\$}0.5 billion for US{\$}50/bbl. oil. The application of conductivity upscaling, often used in electromagnetic modeling to reduce mesh size and thus simulation runtimes, is shown to be inaccurate for the high electrical contrasts needed to represent steel-cased wells in the earth. Fine-scale finite-difference modeling with 12.22-mm cells to capture the steel casing and fractures shows that the steel casing provides a direct current pathway to a created fracture that significantly enhances the response compared with neglecting the steel casing. We consider conductively enhanced proppant, such as coke-breeze-coated sand, and a highly saline brine solution to produce electrically conductive fractures. For a relatively small frac job at a depth of 3 km, involving 5,000 bbl. of slurry and a source midpoint to receiver separation of 50 m, the models show that the conductively enhanced proppant produces a 15{\%} increase in the electric field strength (in-line with the transmitter) in a 10-$\Omega$m background. In a 100-$\Omega$m background, the response due to the proppant increases to 213{\%}. Replacing the conductive proppant by brine with a concentration of 100,000-ppm NaCl, the field strength is increased by 23{\%} in the 100-$\Omega$m background and by 2.3{\%} in the 10-$\Omega$m background. All but the 100,000-ppm NaCl brine in a 10-$\Omega$m background produce calculated fracture-induced electric field increases that are significantly above 2{\%}, a value that has been demonstrated to be observable in field measurements.},

abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions.},

abstract = {We study the theoretical response of electromagnetically energized steel casing in the presence of subsurface variations of electrical resistivity. Casing is energized with a finite-size solenoid antenna located along the axis of the borehole. Measurements consist of the azimuthal component of the electric field acquired either on the surface or in a separate well in the same hydrocarbon field. We assume two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric variations of subsurface electrical resistivity and casing excitation. Simulations of electromagnetic (EM) fields excited by energized steel casing are performed with a goal-oriented hp-adaptive finite-element method that automatically generates a sequence of optimal grids delivering exponential convergence rates in terms of the EM fields at the receiver antennas against CPU time. This advanced finite-element method enables accu-rate modeling of problems with high conductivity contrasts inlarge computational domains. Numerical simulations quantify the measurement sensitivity to variations of frequency, distance from casing to receivers, resistivity of the target oil-bearing layer, and pistonlike radial invasion of water within a target layer initially saturated with oil. When receivers are placed in a nearby well, numerical results indicate that measurements exhibit the largest sensitivity to the target (oil-saturated) layer when the transmitter or receiver antenna is located just above the target layer, and another antenna is located below the target layer. A frequency range from 5-30 Hz provides optimal results for the detection of oil-bearing layers and estimation of radial extent of water invasion. Large horizontal distances (up to 1500 m) between transmitter and receivers and a background material with resistivity above 50 Omega m also enhance the measurement sensitivity to radial variations of water invasion. This sensitivity can be as large as 15{\%}-20{\%} of the measured electric field.},

@article{Nekut1995a,
abstract = {The applicability of crosswell electromagnetic (EM) tomography is limited when the boreholes are steel cased. Steel casing is typically eight orders of magni- tude more conductive than the formations around the borehole. Consequently, the high frequency signals which are needed to resolve the formation conductiv- ity distribution in the interwell region cannot be radi- ated or received by antennas inside the casing. Intro- duction of small insulating gaps in the casing eliminates these problems by creating ports where signals can exit and enter the casing, making the casing an electric bipole antenna. The gapped casing can be operated in a shorted-port or open-port mode. In the shorted-port mode, the voltage is specified at a source port, and the current is measured at all the remaining shorted ports. In the open-port mode, the current is specified at a source port, and the voltage is measured at all the remaining open ports. For high-frequency shorted-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the skin depth in the formations surrounding the casing. For high- frequency open-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the casing gap interval, provided that it is less than the formation skin depth. The open-port mode is preferred. The interval between casing gaps is determined mainly by the well spacing. If the effective bipole length is proportional to the well spacing, the cross- well signal-to-noise ratio is approximately independent of the well spacing and the interwell resolution is approximately proportional to the well spacing at constant source input power. For large well spacings, gapped casing antennas outperform open-hole tools. Steel-cased wells completed or retrofitted with insu- lating gaps offer a stable, low-cost, permanent set of electrodes to implement long-term monitoring of pe- troleum reservoir fluid movements. Gapped casings offer a practical way to achieve high-frequency, wide- aperture EM tomographic datasets at large well spac- ings. Gapped casings can also be used for deep EM probing of the formations around a single well},

Induced‐polarization effects can be simulated in these models by including a complex, frequency‐dependent surface impedance on the outer surface of the cylinder.

abstract = {Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SIMPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples and one field example. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second is a field example that demonstrates a 1D inversion of electromagnetic data collected over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in Australia. The final example is a 3D example which shows how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

abstract = {A new electromagnetic logging method, in which the source is a horizontal loop coaxial with a cased drill hole and the secondary axial fields are measured at depth within the casing, has been analyzed. The analysis, which is for an idealized model of an infinite pipe in a conductive whole space, has shown that the casing and formation are uncoupled at the low frequencies that would be used in field studies. The field inside the casing may be found by first finding the field in the formation and then using this field as an incident field for the pipe alone. This result permits the formation response to be recovered from the measured field in the borehole by applying a correction for the known properties of the casing. If the casing response cannot be accurately predicted, a separate logging tool employing a higher frequency transmitter could be used to determine the required casing parameters in the vicinity of the receiver. This logging technique shows excellent sensitivity to changes in formation conduct...},

abstract = {The implementation of a low-frequency electromagnetic induction tool for propped-fracture detection and diagnostics requires in-depth examination of the reliability and accuracy of the method across fractures with realistic geomechanical features. Likewise, the method relies on the effective placement of electrically conductive proppant within the generated fractures for measurable sensitivity. We invoke a fast Fourier-transform-based volume integral equation simulation method for forward modeling to simulate the electromagnetic response of realistic fracture geometries generated in hydro-fracturing operations and under practical rock conditions. Improved performance is achieved by removing model features which are of little significance to the results and yet cause a significant computational overhead. To properly account for the effective proppant conductivity, we introduce a new technique for the measurement of proppant conductivity using a resistivity core holder. The conductivity of petroleum coke—a potential candidate to be used in the field—is tested in the laboratory. Resulting measurements are used to forward simulate the tool's response to multiple fracture geometries and sizes. Distinct results are obtained for fractures with different spatial distributions of proppant, indicating the possibility of distinguishing between them using a future inverse solver.},

abstract = {Evaluation of hydraulic fractures has been under intensive study since the last decade. Among published works, only a few have included casing effects. This paper focuses on the through-casing electromagnetic (EM) induction imaging method that evaluates hydraulic fractures with enhanced contrasts. An experimental system and an inverse scattering algorithm are presented. The laboratory scaled experimental system is built for the feasibility study of the EM induction imaging method for the through-casing hydraulic fracture evaluation. To develop the inverse scattering algorithm, fractures outside boreholes with metallic casing are modeled by a novel hybrid approximation method. This method combines the distorted Born approximation and the mixed order stabilized bi-conjugate gradient fast Fourier transform method to solve the forward scattering problem. The variational Born iterative method is applied to solve the nonlinear inverse problem iteratively. Experimental results show that the inverse scattering algorithm is effective forEM contrast enhanced through-casing hydraulic fracture evaluation.},

abstract = {We simulate direct current (DC) borehole resistivity measurements acquired in steel-cased deviated wells for the assessment of rock formation properties. The assumed data acquisition configuration considers one current (emitter) and three voltage (collector) electrodes that are utilized to measure the second difference of the electric potential along the well trajectory. We assume a homogeneous, 1.27-cm-thick steel casing with resistivity equal to 10-5 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered} m. Simulations are performed with two different numerical methodologies. The first one is based on transferring two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric optimal grids to a three-dimensional (3D) simulation software. The second one automatically produces optimal 3D grids yielded by a 3D self-adaptive goal-oriented algorithm. Both methodologies utilize high-order finite elements (FE) that are specially well-suited for problems with high-contrast coefficients and rapid spatial variations of the electric field, as it occurs in simulations that involve steel-cased wells. The method based on transferring 2D-optimal grids is efficient in terms of CPU time (few seconds per logging position). Unfortunately, it may produce inaccurate 3D simulations in deviated wells, even though the error remains below 1{\%} for the axisymmetric (vertical) well. The method based on optimal 3D grids, although less efficient in terms of CPU time (few hours per logging position), produces more accurate results that are validated by a built-in a posteriori error estimator. This paper provides the first existing simulations of through-casing resistivity measurements in deviated wells. Simulated resistivity measurements indicate that, for a 30° deviated well, measurements in conductive layers 0.01$\Omega${\textperiodcentered} m) are similar to those obtained in vertical wells. However, in resistive layers (10,000 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered} m), we observe 100{\%} larger readings in the 30° deviated well. This difference becomes 3,000{\%} for the case of a 60° deviated well. For this highly-deviated well, readings corresponding to the conductive formation layer are about 30{\%} smaller in magnitude than those in a vertical well. Shoulder effects significantly vary in deviated wells. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract = {A closed-form solution for a basic model of the through-casing resistivity measurement is found.The so- lution reveals fundamental characteristics of the mea- surement and the dependence of these characteristics on the parameters of the casing and formation. We start our consideration with an analysis of the cur- rent distribution in the vicinity of a single electrode en- ergizing the casing. This analysis shows that the distri- bution becomes axially symmetrical at a distance of just a few radii from the injection point. As a consequence, the number and the physical location of the electrodes used to inject electric current become unimportant if the measurement electrodes are not placed too close to the sensing electrodes. We also derive a closed-form solution for the distri- bution of the current flowing in a homogeneous casing embedded in a homogeneous formation. This consider- ation results in an expression specifying the so-called characteristic length. The electric field potential is ana- lyzed as a function of the vertical and radial distances from the current injection electrode. Explicit closed- form expressions are derived for the electric potential distribution at a distance that is greater or less than the characteristic length. A transition from a cylindrical to spherical pattern of the currentflowoccurs at aradial dis- tance controlled by the characteristic length. This phe- nomenon bounds the “current tube” resistance.Anana- lytical result is also found for the casing surrounded with a homogeneous cement sheath. The concept of the characteristic length is related closely to the geometrical factor of the through-casing resistivitymeasurement.It followsfromoursolution that the geometrical factor displays a significant dependence on the resistivity of the formation and the parameters of the casing. This dependence should be taken into account in the quantitative interpretation of through-casing resistivity logs.},

@article{Nekut1995,
abstract = {The applicability of crosswell electromagnetic (EM) tomography is limited when the boreholes are steel cased. Steel casing is typically eight orders of magni- tude more conductive than the formations around the borehole. Consequently, the high frequency signals which are needed to resolve the formation conductiv- ity distribution in the interwell region cannot be radi- ated or received by antennas inside the casing. Intro- duction of small insulating gaps in the casing eliminates these problems by creating ports where signals can exit and enter the casing, making the casing an electric bipole antenna. The gapped casing can be operated in a shorted-port or open-port mode. In the shorted-port mode, the voltage is specified at a source port, and the current is measured at all the remaining shorted ports. In the open-port mode, the current is specified at a source port, and the voltage is measured at all the remaining open ports. For high-frequency shorted-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the skin depth in the formations surrounding the casing. For high- frequency open-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the casing gap interval, provided that it is less than the formation skin depth. The open-port mode is preferred. The interval between casing gaps is determined mainly by the well spacing. If the effective bipole length is proportional to the well spacing, the cross- well signal-to-noise ratio is approximately independent of the well spacing and the interwell resolution is approximately proportional to the well spacing at constant source input power. For large well spacings, gapped casing antennas outperform open-hole tools. Steel-cased wells completed or retrofitted with insu- lating gaps offer a stable, low-cost, permanent set of electrodes to implement long-term monitoring of pe- troleum reservoir fluid movements. Gapped casings offer a practical way to achieve high-frequency, wide- aperture EM tomographic datasets at large well spac- ings. Gapped casings can also be used for deep EM probing of the formations around a single well},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing is an essential way to improve the production of unconventional shale oil and gas. It is important to characterize the produced fractures using either acoustic or electromagnetic (EM) methods. Conventional EM solvers in the low-frequency range face significant challenges by such multiscale problems where the fracture width is orders of magnitude smaller than its diameters. Furthermore, the cased borehole environment is extremely difficult to simulate with conventional EM solvers due to meshing difficulties and the multiscale nature of the problem. In this paper, we develop a hybrid distorted Born approximation and 3-D mixed ordered stabilized biconju- gate gradient fast Fourier transform (DBA-BCGS-FFT) method to simulate the very challenging 2-D, 2-D-axisymmetric, and 3-D hydraulic fracture models under both open and cased bore- hole environments. Numerical examples show that this method has orders of magnitude higher efficiency than the finite element method. The capabilities of the DBA-BCGS-FFT method for the induction tool fracture mapping are demonstrated by comparing with laboratory experimental results and other reference results.},

abstract = {The presence of steel-cased wells and other infrastructure causes a significant change in the electromagnetic fields that has to be taken into consideration in modeling and interpretation of field data. A realistic and accurate simulation requires the borehole casing to be incorporated into the modeling scheme, which is numerically challenging. Due to the huge conductivity contrast between the casing and surrounding media, a spatial discretization that provides accurate results at different spatial scales ranging from millimeters to hundreds of meters is required. In this paper, we present a full 3D frequency-domain electromagnetic modeling based on a parallel finite-difference algorithm considering the casing effect and investigate its applicability on the borehole-to-surface configuration of the Hontom{\{}{\'{i}}{\}}n CO2 storage site. To guarantee a robust solution of linear systems with highly ill-conditioned matrices caused by huge conductivity contrasts and multiple spatial scales in the model, we employ direct sparse solvers. Different scenarios are simulated in order to study the influence of the source position, conductivity model, and the effect of the steel casing on the measured data. Several approximations of the real hollow casing that allow for a large reduction in the number of elements in the resulting meshes are studied. A good agreement between the modeled responses and the real field data demonstrates the feasibility of simulating casing effects in complex geological areas. The steel casing of the well greatly increases the amplitude of the surface electromagnetic fields and thus improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the sensitivity to deep targets.},

abstract = {To advance and optimize secondary and tertiary oil recovery techniques, it is essential to know the areal propagation and distribution of the injected fluids in the subsurface. We investigate the applicability of controlled-source electromagnetic methods to monitor fluid movements in a German oilfield (Bockstedt, onshore Northwest Germany) as injected brines (highly saline formation water) have much lower electrical resistivity than the oil within the reservoir. The main focus of this study is on controlled-source electromagnetic simulations to test the sensitivity of various source–receiver configurations. The background model for the simulations is based on two-dimensional inversion of magnetotelluric data gathered across the oil field and calibrated with resistivity logs. Three-dimensional modelling results suggest that controlled-source electromagnetic methods are sensitive to resistivity changes at reservoir depths, but the effect is difficult to resolve with surface measurements only. Resolution increases significantly if sensors or transmitters can be placed in observation wells closer to the reservoir. In particular, observation of the vertical electric field component in shallow boreholes and/or use of source configurations consisting of combinations of vertical and horizontal dipoles are promising. Preliminary results from a borehole-to-surface controlled-source electromagnetic field survey carried out in spring 2014 are in good agreement with the modelling studies.},

@article{Rucker2010,
abstract = {An electrical-resistivity survey was completed at the T tank farm at the Hanford nuclear site in Washington State, U.S.A. The purpose of the survey was to define the lateral extent of waste plumes in the vadose zone in and around the tank farm. The T tank farm consists of single-shell tanks that historically have leaked and many liquid-waste-disposal facilities that provide a good target for resistivity mapping. Given that the site is highly industrialized with near-surface metallic infrastructure that potentially could mask any interpretable waste plume, it was necessary to use the many wells around the site as long electrodes. To accommodate the long electrodes and to simulate the effects of a linear conductor, the resistivity inversion code was modified to assign low-resistivity values to the well's location. The forward model within the resistivity code was benchmarked for accuracy against an analytic solution, and the inverse model was tested for its ability to recreate images of a hypothetical target. The results of the tank-farm field survey showed large, low-resistivity targets beneath the disposal areas that coincided with the conceptual hydrogeologic models developed regarding the releases. Additionally, in areas of minimal infrastructure, the long-electrode method matched the lateral footprint of a 3D surface-resistivity survey with reasonable fidelity. Based on these results, the long-electrode resistivity method may provide a new strategy for environmental characterization at highly industrialized sites, provided a sufficient number and density of wells exist. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {The goal of this project is to develop techniques for monitoring hydraulic fractures in reservoirs by injecting electrically conductive, dielectric, or magnetically permeable proppants. The contrasts between the properties of the proppants and the subsurface provided the basis for imaging using geophysical methods. The initial experiments focused on a series of small, shallow fractures; however, the goal of the project is to develop methods applicable to oil-field fractures. The project began by screening different proppant types using laboratory and numerical analyses that have been ongoing by researchers at the Advanced Energy Consortium (AEC). This work identified Loresco coke breeze and steel shot as materials that could create significant electrical or magnetic contrasts with most geological formations. These proppants were tested by creating hydraulic fractures in a shallow field setting consisting of highly weathered residual saprolite near Clemson University in western South Carolina. Six hydraulic fractures were created in highly monitored cells by injecting the contrasting proppants at a depth of approximately 1.5 m. This created sub-horizontal fractures filled with proppant approximately 10 mm thick and extending 3 to 5 m in maximum dimension. Each cell had a dense array of electrodes and magnetic sensors on the surface, as well as four shallow vertical electrode arrays that were used to obtain data before and after hydraulic fracturing. Net vertical displacement, cores and trenching were used to characterize the fracture geometries. Hydraulic fracture geometries were estimated by inverting pre-and post-injection geophysical data using various codes. Data from cores and excavation show that the hydraulic fractures formed a saucer-shape with a preferred propagation in the horizontal direction. The geophysical inversions generated images with remarkably similar form, size, and location to the ground truth from direct observation. Displacement and tilt data appear promising as a constraint on fracture geometry.},

abstract = {A new electromagnetic logging method, in which the source is a horizontal loop coaxial with a cased drill hole and the secondary axial fields are measured at depth within the casing, has been analyzed. The analysis, which is for an idealized model of an infinite pipe in a conductive whole space, has shown that the casing and formation are uncoupled at the low frequencies that would be used in field studies. The field inside the casing may be found by first finding the field in the formation and then using this field as an incident field for the pipe alone. This result permits the formation response to be recovered from the measured field in the borehole by applying a correction for the known properties of the casing. If the casing response cannot be accurately predicted, a separate logging tool employing a higher frequency transmitter could be used to determine the required casing parameters in the vicinity of the receiver. This logging technique shows excellent sensitivity to changes in formation conduct...},

abstract = {We present a numerical study for 3D time-lapse electromagnetic monitoring of a fictitious CO2 sequestration using the geometry of a real geological site and a suite of suitable electromagnetic methods with different source/receiver configurations and different sensitivity patterns. All available geological information is processed and directly implemented into the computational domain, which is discretized by unstructured tetrahedral grids. We thus demonstrate the performance capability of our numerical simulation techniques. The scenario considers a CO2 injection in approximately 1100 m depth. The expected changes in conductivity were inferred from preceding laboratory measurements. A resistive anomaly is caused within the conductive brines of the undisturbed reservoir horizon. The resistive nature of the anomaly is enhanced by the CO2 dissolution regime, which prevails in the high-salinity environment. Due to the physicochemical properties of CO2, the affected portion of the subsurface is laterally widespread but very thin. We combine controlled-source electromagnetics, borehole transient electromagnetics, and the direct-current resistivity method to perform a virtual experiment with the aim of scrutinizing a set of source/receiver configurations with respect to coverage, resolution, and detectability of the anomalous CO2 plume prior to the field survey. Our simulation studies are carried out using the 3D codes developed in our working group. They are all based on linear and higher order Lagrange and N{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}lec finite-element formulations on unstructured grids, providing the necessary flexibility with respect to the complex real-world geometry. We provide different strategies for addressing the accuracy of numerical simulations in the case of arbitrary structures. The presented computations demonstrate the expected great advantage of positioning transmitters or receivers close to the target. For direct-current geoelectrics, 50{\%} change in electric potential may be detected even at the Earth's surface. Monitoring with inductive methods is also promising. For a well-positioned surface transmitter, more than 10{\%} difference in the vertical electric field is predicted for a receiver located 200 m above the target. Our borehole transient electromagnetics results demonstrate that traditional transient electromagnetics with a vertical magnetic dipole source is not well suited for monitoring a thin horizontal resistive target. This is due to the mainly horizontal current system, which is induced by a vertical magnetic dipole.},

abstract = {Gas hydrates are a potential energy resource, a possible factor in climate change and an exploration geohazard. The University of Toronto has deployed a permanent seafloor time-domain controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) system offshore Vancouver Island, within the framework of the NEPTUNE Canada underwater cabled obser-vatory. Hydrates are known to be present in the area and due to their electrically resistive nature can be monitored by 5 permanent electric field receivers. However, two cased boreholes may be drilled near the CSEM site in the near future. To un-derstand any potential distortions of the electric fields due to the metal, we model the marine electromagnetic response of a conductive steel borehole casing. First, we consider the commonly used canonical model consisting of a 100m, 100 m thick resistive hydrocarbon layer embedded at a depth of 1000 m in a 1m conductive host medium, with the addition of a typical steel production casing extending from the seafloor to the resistive zone. Results show that in both the frequency and time domains the distortion produced by the casing occurs at smaller transmitter-receiver offsets than the offsets required to detect the resistive layer. Second, we consider the experimentally determined model of the offshore Vancouver Island hydrate zone, consisting of a 5.5m, 36m thick hydrate layer overlying a 0.7m sedimentary half-space, with the addition of two borehole casings extending 300 m into the seafloor. In this case, results show that the distortion produced by casings located within a 100 m safety zone of the CSEM system will be measured at 4 of the 5 receivers. We conclude that the boreholes must be positioned at least 200 m away from the CSEM array so as to minimize the effects of the casings.},

@article{Caudillo-Mata2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. Electromagnetic simulations of complex geologic settings are computationally expensive. One reason for this is the fact that a fine mesh is required to accurately discretize the electrical conductivity model of a given setting. This conductivity model may vary over several orders of magnitude and these variations can occur over a large range of length scales. Using a very fine mesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a large system of equations that is often difficult to deal with. To keep the simulations computationally tractable, coarse meshes are often employed for the discretization of the model. Such coarse meshes typically fail to capture the fine-scale variations in the conductivity model resulting in inaccuracies in the predicted data. In this work, we introduce a framework for constructing a coarse-mesh or upscaled conductivity model based on a prescribed fine-mesh model. Rather than using analytical expressions, we opt to pose upscaling as a parameter estimation problem. By solving an optimization problem, we obtain a coarse-mesh conductivity model. The optimization criterion can be tailored to the survey setting in order to produce coarse models that accurately reproduce the predicted data generated on the fine mesh. This allows us to upscale arbitrary conductivity structures, as well as to better understand the meaning of the upscaled quantity. We use 1D and 3D examples to demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to emulate the behavior of the heterogeneity in the fine-mesh conductivity model, and to produce an accurate description of the desired predicted data obtained by using a coarse mesh in the simulation process.},

This is particularly true when working with data sets where it may not even be clear how to plot the data: 3D direct current resistivity and induced polarization surveys (it is not necessarily clear how to organize data into a pseudosection) or multicomponent data, such as electromagnetic data (we can measure three spatial components of electric and/or magnetic fields through time over a range of frequencies). Inversion is a tool for translating these data into a model we can interpret. The goal of the inversion is to find a "model" - some description of the earth's physical properties - that is consistent with both the data and geologic knowledge.},

Although several geophysical methods have been applied to map the fractures from the deformation or the induced microseismic events that they cause, these methods do not image the sections of the fractures held open by injected proppant. This is where electromagnetics (EM) can help. We investigate EM methods of imaging and monitoring induced fractures from the distribution of a proppant. Here, we apply some novel field technologies, effective medium theory, and a modified proppant mix to image the propped section of an induced fracture.

Modeling shows that the electromagnetic fields at reservoir depths can be 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than those on the seabed, thus opening up the possibility to see deeper or detect and monitor smaller targets. In the case of measurements inside metal casing, the use of reciprocity to interchange the source and receiver allows the casing conductor to be considered as an antenna. This antenna is excited by a source inside the casing, which induces a current flowing along the casing conductor. Based on the current distribution, a casing dipole moment and an equivalent length were derived for the transverse magnetic (TM) mode. In the frequency range of interest (0.1–10 Hz), the increase in field strength (resulting fromsea-to-borehole measurements) is not lost to the casing attenuation for either the TM or the transverse electric (TE) mode.

abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) methods are used to characterize the electrical conductivity distribution of the earth. Since EM methods consider time-varying fields, we typically treat EM in either the frequency domain (FD) or the time domain (TD). Recently, due in part to computational advances, EM geophysical surveys are increasingly being simulated and inverted in 3D. However, the availability of computational resources does not invalidate the use of lower dimensional formulations and methods, which can be useful depending on the geological complexity as well as the survey geometry. For example, we can treat the measured EM data either in TD or FD, and a progressive procedure can be used to invert these data, starting with 1D inversions, then moving to multi-dimensional inversions. As such, we require a set of tools that allow a geophysicists to easily move between dimensions and formulations of the EM problem. This is the motivation behind the open source software package SimPEG-EM which is part of a software ecosystem for Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics (SimPEG). In this presentation, we will share examples as well as our experience from creating a range of simulation and inversion tools for EM methods that span dimensions (1D, 2.5D and 3D) and apply analytic, FD and TD formulations in a consistent framework. The flexibility and consistency in our EM package allows us to be methodical so that we have the capacity to tackle a spectrum of problems in EM geophysics.},

abstract = {Methods using dc electrical arrays to measure for- mation resistivity through casing have relied on ap- proximate forms for the current and potential distribu- tions to derive a simple relationship between the formation resistivity and the transverse resistance calculated from measurements of the potential and its second derivative inside the casing. We have derived a numerical solution for the potentials and their deriva- tives to examine the accuracy of the approximate forms for casing of finite-length, annular zones of varying radius, and for vertical discontinuities such as layers or abrupt changes in annular zone radius. For typical conductivity contrasts between the casing and formation, the approximate relationships may be off by as much as 60 percent for long casing and may show variations of 20 to 30 percent as the electrode array moves along the casing. In principle an iterative scheme could be devised to correct the readings if high accuracy was required. The numerical results show that to first order the current flow from the casing is radial, and that all the analytic expressions based on this assumption for evaluating layer resolution and the effects of annular layers are valid. An interesting byproduct of this study has been the discovery that the distortion of the potentials in a nearby well by an annular disk (e.g., an injected steam zone) surrounding the current injection well is greater if the injection well is cased. Crosswell resistivity surveys appear feasible if one of the wells is cased},

abstract = {Floodplains play an important role in catchment hydrology, representing a zone in which groundwater is shallow, and groundwater - atmosphere interactions through evapotranspiration (ET) are more pronounced. Spatial patterns in evapotranspiration develop due to the variable distribution and type of floodplain sediments, patterns of vegetation type, floodplain elevation and geometry. Where groundwater is saline, as in the lower River Murray in South Australia, evapotranspiration concentrates salt and can lead to floodplain salinisation, vegetation dieback or health decline. Modelling these systems can assist our understanding of which areas of vegetation are at high risk from salinisation in order to target them for management. However, models of this scale require detailed data for parameter population and validation. This paper discusses the potential application of airborne, ground and “in- river” electromagnetic techniques to indicate spatial patterns of groundwater evapotranspiration and baseflow from a salinising floodplain on the lower River Murray. High resolution RESOLVE frequency domain helicopter EM data are examined along with ‘in river' NanoTEM and ground EM31 data. Their study demonstrated the scale of variations in baseflow was smaller than expected, showing alternation between losing and gaining (from a salt load perspective) groundwater in a river broadly understood to be a gaining system. The HEM and ground data sets are strongly correlated with groundwater salinity and are now being trialed as a basis for validating groundwater models.},

abstract = {The native riparian vegetation communities on the Chowilla floodplain in the lower River Murray in South Australia are suffering severe declines in health, particularly the Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. (red gum) and Eucalyptus largiflorens F.Muell. (black box) communities. The primary cause of the decline is salinisation of the floodplain soils caused by increased rates of groundwater discharge and hence increased movement of salt up into the plant root zone. The salinity is driven by a lack of flooding and rising saline groundwater tables. Rises in the naturally saline groundwater levels are due to the effects of river regulation from Lock 6 and high inflows from regional groundwater levels increased by Lake Victoria to the east. River regulation has also led to reduced frequency and duration of the floods that leach salt from the plant root zone and supply fresh water for transpiration. The frequency of medium-sized floods occurring on Chowilla has been reduced by a factor of three since locking and water extractions were commenced in the 1920s to provide reliable water for urban and agricultural use. The soil salinisation on the floodplain was modelled by using a spatial and temporal model of salt accumulation from groundwater depth, groundwater salinity, soil type and flooding frequency. The derived soil water availability index (WINDS) is used to infer vegetation health and was calibrated against current extent of vegetation health as assessed from fieldwork and satellite image analysis. The modelling work has shown that there is a severe risk to the floodplain vegetation from current flow regimes. This paper estimates that 65{\%} (5658 ha) of the 8600 ha of floodplain trees are affected by soil salinisation matching a field survey of vegetation health in 2003 (Department of Environment and Heritage 2005a), compared with 40{\%} in 1993 (Taylor et al. 1996). Model results show that the best management option for Chowilla is lowering the groundwater down to 2 m below current levels, which predicts an improvement in the health of the floodplain tree species from 35 to 42{\%}.},

abstract = {It is often argued that3Dinversion of entire airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys is impractical, and that1D methods provide the only viable option for quantitative interpretation. However, real geological formations are 3D by nature and 3D inversion is required to produce accurate images of the subsurface. To that end, we show that it is practical to invert entireAEMsurveys to3Dconductivitymodelswithhundredsof thousandsif not millions of elements.Thekeyto solving a3D AEM inversion problem is the application of a moving footprint approach. We have exploited the fact that the area of the footprint of an AEM system is significantly smaller than the area of an AEM survey, and developed a robust 3D inversion method that uses a moving footprint. Our implementation is based on the3Dintegral equation method for computing data and sensitivities, and uses the re-weighted regularised conjugate gradient method for minimising the objective functional. We demonstrate our methodology with the 3D inversion of AEM data acquired for salinity mapping over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in South Australia. We have inverted 146 line km of RESOLVE data for a 3D conductivity model with {\~{}}310 000 elements in 45 min using just five processors of a multi-processor workstation.},

@article{Heagy2016,
abstract = {Simulations and inversions of geophysical electromagnetic data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, definition of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SimPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second example demonstrates how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

@article{Yang2014,
abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions.},

@article{Pidlisecky2011,
abstract = {Difference geophysical tomography (e. g. radar, resistivity and seismic) is used increasingly for imaging fluid flow and mass transport associated with natural and engineered hydrologic phenomena, including tracer experiments, in situ remediation and aquifer storage and recovery. Tomographic data are collected over time, inverted and differenced against a background image to produce 'snapshots' revealing changes to the system; these snapshots readily provide qualitative information on the location and morphology of plumes of injected tracer, remedial amendment or stored water. In principle, geometric moments (i.e. total mass, centres of mass, spread, etc.) calculated from difference tomograms can provide further quantitative insight into the rates of advection, dispersion and mass transfer; however, recent work has shown that moments calculated from tomograms are commonly biased, as they are strongly affected by the subjective choice of regularization criteria. Conventional approaches to regularization (Tikhonov) and parametrization (image pixels) result in tomograms which are subject to artefacts such as smearing or pixel estimates taking on the sign opposite to that expected for the plume under study. Here, we demonstrate a novel parametrization for imaging plumes associated with hydrologic phenomena. Capitalizing on the mathematical analogy between moment-based descriptors of plumes and the moment-based parameters of probability distributions, we design an inverse problem that (1) is overdetermined and computationally efficient because the image is described by only a few parameters, (2) produces tomograms consistent with expected plume behaviour (e. g. changes of one sign relative to the background image), (3) yields parameter estimates that are readily interpreted for plume morphology and offer direct insight into hydrologic processes and (4) requires comparatively few data to achieve reasonable model estimates. We demonstrate the approach in a series of numerical examples based on straight-ray difference-attenuation radar monitoring of the transport of an ionic tracer, and show that the methodology outlined here is particularly effective when limited data are available.},

abstract = {We present a 3D inversion methodology for multisource time-domain electromagnetic data. The forward model consists of Maxwell's equations in time where the permeability is fixed but electrical conductivity can be highly discontinuous. The goal of the inversion is to recover the conductivity-given measurements of the electric and/or magnetic fields. The availability of matrix-factorization software and high-performance computing has allowed us to solve the 3D time domain EM problem using direct solvers. This is particularly advantageous when data from many transmitters and over many decades are available. We first formulate Maxwell's equations in terms of the magnetic field, (H) over arrow . The problem is then discretized using a finite volume technique in space and backward Euler in time. The forward operator is symmetric positive definite and a Cholesky decomposition can be performed with the work distributed over an array of processors. The forward modeling is quickly carried out using the factored operator. Time savings are considerable and they make 3D inversion of large ground or airborne data sets feasible. This is illustrated by using synthetic examples and by inverting a multisource UTEM field data set acquired at San Nicolas, which is a massive sulfide deposit in Mexico.},

The earth is modeled as a set of horizontal layers with constant conductivity, and the data are apparent resistivities and phases computed from orthogonal electric and magnetic fields due to a finite dipole source. The earth model has many layers compared to the number of data points, and therefore the solution is nonunique. Among the possible solutions, we seek a model with desired character by minimizing a particular model objective function. Traditionally, CSAMT data are inverted either by using the far‐field data where magnetotelluric (MT) equations are valid or by correcting the near‐field data to an equivalent plane‐wave approximation. Here, we invert both apparent resistivity and phase data from the near‐field transition zone and the far‐field regions in the full CSAMT inversion without any correction.

abstract = {We investigate a new algorithm for computing regularized solutions of the 2-D magnetotelluric inverse problem. The algorithm employs a nonlinear conjugate gradients (NLCG) scheme to minimize an objective function that penalizes data residuals and second spatial derivatives of resistivity. We compare this algorithm theoretically and numerically to two previous algorithms for constructing such "minimum-structure" models: the Gauss-Newton method, which solves a sequence of linearized inverse problems and has been the standard approach to nonlinear inversion in geophysics, and an algorithm due to Mackie and Madden, which solves a sequence of linearized inverse problems incompletely using a (linear) conjugate gradients technique. Numerical experiments involving synthetic and field data indicate that the two algorithms based on conjugate gradients (NLCG and Mackie-Madden) are more efficient than the Gauss-Newton algorithm in terms of both computer memory requirements and CPU time needed to find accurate solutions to problems of realistic size. This owes largely to the fact that the conjugate gradients-based algorithms avoid two computationally intensive tasks that are performed at each step of a Gauss-Newton iteration: calculation of the full Jacobian matrix of the forward modeling operator, and complete solution of a linear system on the model space. The numerical tests also show that the Mackie-Madden algorithm reduces the objective function more quickly than our new NLCG algorithm in the early stages of minimization, but NLCG is more effective in the later computations. To help understand these results, we describe the Mackie-Madden and new NLCG algorithms in detail and couch each as a special case of a more general conjugate gradients scheme for nonlinear inversion.},

@article{Oldenburg2000,
abstract = {We develop three methods to invert induced polar- ization (IP) data. The foundation for our algorithms is an assumption that the ultimate effect of chargeability is to alter the effective conductivity when current is applied. This assumption, which was first put forth by Siegel and has been routinely adopted in the literature, permits the IP responses to be numerically modeled by carrying out two forward modelings using a DC resis- tivity algorithm. The intimate connection between DC and IP data means that inversion of IP data is a two-step process. First, the DC potentials are inverted to recover a background conductivity. The distribu- tion of chargeability can then be found by using any one of the three following techniques: (1) linearizing the IP data equation and solving a linear inverse problem, (2) manipulating the conductivities obtained after performing two DC resistivity inversions, and (3) solving a nonlinear inverse problem. Our procedure for performing the inversion is to divide the earth into rectangular prisms and to assume that the conductivity and chargeability are constant in each cell. To emulate complicated earth structure we allow many cells, usually far more than there are data. The inverse problem, which has many solutions, is then solved as a problem in optimization theory. A model objective function is de- signed, and a model (either the distribution of or is sought that minimizes the objective function subject to adequately fitting the data. Generalized subspace meth- odologies are used to solve both inverse problems, and positivity constraints are included. The IP inversion procedures we design are generic and can be applied to l-D, 2-D, or 3-D earth models and with any configuration of current and potential electrodes. We illustrate our methods by inverting synthetic DC/IP data taken over a 2-D earth structure and by inverting dipole-dipole data taken in Quebec},

Modular sensitivity computations and generic interfaces to parallelized inversion algorithms provide a ready framework for rapid implementation of new applications or inversion algorithms.

abstract = {We consider the problem of designing a dynamic scheduling strategy that takes into account both workload and memory information in the context of the parallel multifrontal factorization. The originality of our approach is that we base our estimations (work and memory) on a static optimistic scenario during the analysis phase. This scenario is then used during the factorization phase to constrain the dynamic decisions that compute fully irregular partitions in order to better balance the workload. We show that our new scheduling algorithm significantly improves both the memory behaviour and the factorization time. We give experimental results for large challenging real-life 3D problems on 64 and 128 processors.},

Aimed at filling this gap, we analyze the contact process, i.e., the simplest propagation model, with quenched disorder on complex networks. We find Griffiths phases and other rare-region effects, leading rather generically to anomalously slow (algebraic, logarithmic, relaxation, on Erdos-R{\'{e}}nyi networks. Similar effects are predicted to exist for other topologies with a finite percolation threshold. More surprisingly, we find that Griffiths phases can also emerge in the absence of quenched disorder, as a consequence of topological heterogeneity in networks with finite topological dimension. These results have a broad spectrum of implications for propagation phenomena and other dynamical processes on networks.},

EM tomographic inversion, in two-dimensional (2-D) Cartesian geometry, is illustrated for a crosshole sourcereceiver configuration. The object function of the conductivity distribution is related to the transformed and filtered data by an inverse Fourier transform in the vertical direction and an inverse Laplace transform in the lateral direction. The reconstructed conductivity image is found to be a band-limited version of the actual conductivity distribution. To stabilize the inversion, a regularized least-squares method is used for image reconstruction. As in the seismic case, the inversion quality can be understood by inspecting the wavenumber domain coverage of the object function. Numerical experiments show that the resolution is better in the vertical direction than in the horizontal and it is also a function of source operating frequency. The position and attitude of the target are recovered well.},

abstract = {The development of an electromagnetic numerical modelling scheme for a magnetic dipole in an arbitrary casing segment in an inhomogeneous conductivity background has been difficult, due to the very high electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability contrasts between the steel casing and the background medium. To investigate the effect of steel casing efficiently, we have developed an accurate but simple finite-element modelling scheme to simulate electromagnetic fields in a medium of cylindrically symmetric conductivity structures. In order to preserve the cylindrical symmetry in the resulting electromagnetic fields, a horizontal loop current source is used throughout. One of the main advantages of the approach is that the problem is scalar when formulated using the azimuthal electric field, even if the casing is both electrically conductive and magnetically permeable. Field calculations have been made inside the cased borehole as well as in another borehole which is not cased. Careful analyses of the numerical modelling results indicate that the anomaly observed in a cross-borehole configuration is sensitive enough to be used for tomographic imaging.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The electric field on the borehole axis in the pres- ence of a casing can be divided into three zones: the near, intermediate, and far zones. Within the interme- diate zone, determination of the second derivative of the potential allows me to define the formation resis- tivity. Outside the casing, the electric field, at large distances from the borehole, has a radial direction that provides a sufficient depth of investigation in this direction. The measurement requires knowledge of the casing conductance. Application of transmission line theory is based on the fact that the electric field in the formation is radial within the intermediate zone, re- sulting in the conclusion that the vertical resolution of such a measurement would depend only upon the spacing of the electrodes required to estimate the second derivative of the potential.},

@article{Bevc1991,
abstract = {A field experiment was conducted at the University of California Richmond Field Station to demonstrate the sensitivity of borehole-to-surface resistivity measurements in groundwater investigations. A quantity of saline water was injected into a fresh water aquifer while the resistivity was monitored using a multichannel borehole-to-surface system. Two experiments were conducted using pole-pole and pole-dipole receiver electrode arrays. The data from the pole-pole experiment were superimposed to simulate a dipole-pole array and the data from the pole-dipole array were superimposed to simulate a dipole-dipole array. This superposition of the data was done to enhance the anomaly and facilitate interpretation. A numerical modeling study was performed in conjunction with the field experiment in order to interprete the results. A three-dimensional modeling program was used to simulate the geological setting of the field experiment and the salt water injection. This modeling revealed that an asymmetric displacement of the salt water slug results in asymmetric current channeling which is observable as a 25 to 40 percent difference between preinjection and postinjection borehole-to-surface resistivity. In addition to demonstrating the sensitivity of subsurface arrays, this experiment demonstrated that the measurement of bulk resistivity can identify a groundwater flow pattern not detected by hydrological measurements.},

@article{Pidlisecky2011,
abstract = {Difference geophysical tomography (e. g. radar, resistivity and seismic) is used increasingly for imaging fluid flow and mass transport associated with natural and engineered hydrologic phenomena, including tracer experiments, in situ remediation and aquifer storage and recovery. Tomographic data are collected over time, inverted and differenced against a background image to produce 'snapshots' revealing changes to the system; these snapshots readily provide qualitative information on the location and morphology of plumes of injected tracer, remedial amendment or stored water. In principle, geometric moments (i.e. total mass, centres of mass, spread, etc.) calculated from difference tomograms can provide further quantitative insight into the rates of advection, dispersion and mass transfer; however, recent work has shown that moments calculated from tomograms are commonly biased, as they are strongly affected by the subjective choice of regularization criteria. Conventional approaches to regularization (Tikhonov) and parametrization (image pixels) result in tomograms which are subject to artefacts such as smearing or pixel estimates taking on the sign opposite to that expected for the plume under study. Here, we demonstrate a novel parametrization for imaging plumes associated with hydrologic phenomena. Capitalizing on the mathematical analogy between moment-based descriptors of plumes and the moment-based parameters of probability distributions, we design an inverse problem that (1) is overdetermined and computationally efficient because the image is described by only a few parameters, (2) produces tomograms consistent with expected plume behaviour (e. g. changes of one sign relative to the background image), (3) yields parameter estimates that are readily interpreted for plume morphology and offer direct insight into hydrologic processes and (4) requires comparatively few data to achieve reasonable model estimates. We demonstrate the approach in a series of numerical examples based on straight-ray difference-attenuation radar monitoring of the transport of an ionic tracer, and show that the methodology outlined here is particularly effective when limited data are available.},

abstract = {Pipe corrosion is a natural phenomenon in the harsh environment of oil and gas production wells, costing billions of dollars each year. Monitoring such corrosion allows for timely mitigation to prevent leaks, environmental damage, or catastrophic failures. Corrosion of pipes is inferred from measurement of internal diameter and wall thickness. Mechanical finger calipers provide a high-resolution image of the internal pipe surface. Ultrasonic tools measure both the internal diameter and thickness of a single pipe, providing the pipe is filled with a fluid. Production tubing is a barrier to caliper, ultrasonic, and flux-leakage electromagnetic tools, preventing the assessment of outer casings. Remote-Field Eddy-Current (RFEC) tools respond to the total metal thickness of all the combined casings. The measurement is valid in single and multiple casing strings and is largely insensitive to the kind of material filling the pipe. This paper presents a new slim electromagnetic (EM) imaging tool enabling casing assessment without removing the production tubing. The tool excites eddy-currents in the tubulars using a powerful low-frequency solenoidal transmitter. Distribution and strength of the eddy-currents depend on the geometric properties of the casings, their EM properties, and the presence of defects. The tool operates in the RFEC regime using large transmitter-receiver spacings, in which the measurements directly determine the total metal thickness. Mandrel-mounted coils provide the average total metal thickness, and eighteen small pad sensors around the tool provide an image of local pipe wall metal loss. The combination of low- and high-frequency images, together with the average total metal thickness, provides a quantitative, high-resolution assessment of pipe condition. Log examples show detection of casing joints, additional casings strings, and presence of corrosion damage in the low- and high-frequency images.

abstract = {A simulation and sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the properties of a casing source excited by connecting the electrodes of a long vertical bipole antenna at the top and bottom ends of the pipe. It has been demonstrated that the casing source yields a field distribution that resembles that of the bipole antenna in an open hole. Indeed the casing current can be regarded as an attenuated version of the vertical antenna that excites the pipe. Sensitivity to the properties of finite size targets is well preserved when using the casing source. It has been demonstrated that sensitivity is higher to resistive than conductive targets. The effect of channeling current along the conductor is small, as current flows preferentially along the metallic casing. On the other hands the presence of resistive bodies yields a deviation of the current lines around the resistors which manifests strongly in the current density observed at the surface.},

abstract = {The first Borehole to Surface Electromagnetic (BSEM) pilot field survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was successfully executed to identify oil and water bearing reservoir layers in a carbonate oilfield water injection zone. Maximizing recovery factor by means of detailed mapping of hydrocarbon accumulations in the reservoirs is a key requirement for oil producing companies. This mapping is done routinely by accurate measurements of fluid distribution at the wells' locations, but a knowledge gap exists in the inter-well volumes, where typically only density-based measurements are available (seismic and gravity). Such technologies are not always effective to discriminate and quantify the fluids in the porous space (especially when difference in fluid densities is small, such as oil and water). On the contrary, when high electrical resistivity contrasts exist between hydrocarbons and water, electromagnetic (EM) based technologies have the potential to map the distribution of the fluids and monitor their movement during the life of the field, hundreds of meters or kilometers away from the wellbores. The objective of a BSEM survey is to obtain fluid sensitive resistivity and induced polarization maps. These are based on an acquisition grid at the surface, a few kilometers around the EM transmitting well, which reveal oil and water bearing zones in the investigated reservoir layers. In this pilot field test, BSEM showed the potential to map water-front movements in an area of about 4km from the single well surveyed, evaluate the sweep efficiency, identify bypassed/ lagged oil zones, and eventually monitor the fluid displacements, if surveys are repeated over time. The data quality of the recorded signals is highly satisfactory. Fluid distribution maps obtained with BSEM are coherent with production data measured at the wells' locations, filling the knowledge gap of the inter- wells area. Three key R{\&}D objectives for this BSEM pilot are achieved. Firstly, the capability to record at the surface EM signals generated in the reservoir, secondly, the capability of BSEM to discriminate between oil and water saturated reservoir zones, and finally obtain resistivity maps and a fluid distribution estimate plausible and coherent with the information obtained from well logs, crosswell EM, production data and reservoir models. In addition to reservoir monitoring, BSEM can be very useful in non-diagnosed areas like exploration fields for hydrocarbon exploitations.},

abstract = {Electrical logging in cased holes is a subject of strong current interest. In this paper we develop the conventional theory of physical responses of electrical logging through casing where the formation resistivity changes vertically and where the conductance of the casing varies. The theory is developed for a four-electrode sonde with one current electrode, and three receiver electrodes that measure current leakage into the formation. All the theoretical developments in the paper are derived using approximate transmission-line theory. An expression for the array coefficient is first derived and then used to obtain an expression for the apparent conductivity of the formation. Then a relation is established between the array coefficient, geometrical factor and conductance of the casing. This step led to a method of measuring casing conductance. Knowing casing conductance, the response of the array to vertical changes in formation conductivity is measurable. It was established, that when the array length is less than the thickness of the formation layer, the measured apparent conductivity is equivalent to the true conductivity of the formation, unlike the case of normal and induction logs. It was also established that measurement of apparent conductivity can be made accurately inside a casing of finite length when it essentially exceeds the length of the electrode array. The results contained in this paper show that electrical logging through casing is possible in wells with conventional casing strings that penetrate layered sedimentary formations.},

abstract = {Unexpected borehole measurements are often inaccurately interpreted due to limited knowledge of the formation, particularly in tight-gas unconventional reservoirs. A novel method was applied to determine reservoir quality and the reliability of borehole array-induction resistivity measurements in a tight gas sandstone reservoir. Four exploration wells drilled with synthetic oil-based mud showed conflicting resistivity profiles. The discovery well showed a conductive invasion profile, but the appraisal wells showed resistive profiles. Simulation of oil-based mud-filtrate invasion was coupled with forward simulation and inversion of array-induction resistivity measurements to determine the difference in such resistivity profiles. Laboratory measurements on rock core and fluid samples were used to calibrate a log-based petrophysical model that was necessary to simulate the physics of fluid-flow mud-filtrate invasion. The dynamic process of invasion was simulated with a multicomponent formulation for the hydrocarbon phase and rock wettability alteration effects due to surfactants present in the mud. Simulated borehole-resistivity measurements were compared to field logs, and the rock properties were modified to secure a close agreement between simulated and field logs. The different invasion profiles corresponded to variable rock quality and mud composition. In the discovery well, good rock quality and thick surfactants in the mud caused a low mobility ratio between filtrate and native fluids, which created a water bank that moved ahead into the formation. This effect created a conductive annulus in the near-wellbore region. In turn, the deep invasion and high resistivity are due to excellent rock quality that is typical of a conventional sandstone reservoir. The shallower invasion and resistive profiles in the delineation wells suggest the tight gas sandstone reservoir we expected to find throughout the formation.},

The feasibility of measuring low-frequency magnetic fields through such steel-cased wells is of great interest for monitoring fluid movement during production. We report on experimental and modeling results regarding the effect of steel casing on electromagnetic signals transmitted through them. This effect includes the attenuation and phase shift of a signal diffusing through the casing wall. Sample casings are studied under low field strength in the linear regime where the casing's electrical properties are independent of the applied signals. Frequency spectra are measured for transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polariza- tions from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Numerical models, devel- oped to simulate the casing response, match the ex- perimental data very well. Finally, studies of the effects of the earth's magnetic field and casing rema- nent magnetization show that these steady biases do not affect the ac signal detection.},

abstract = {Microseismic monitoring (MSM) of hydraulic fracture treatments is routine in North America and has added significantly to our understanding of fracture growth. The interpretation of microseismic images is advancing steadily, extracting more information from event patterns, temporal evolution, and acoustic waveforms. The increasing amount of information from MSM provides significant opportunities to improve stimulation designs, completion strategies, and field development. However, the applications of microseismic interpretations are many times ill-defined, overlooked, or not applied properly. Numerous applications of microseismic measurements have been documented in technical publications, typically in the form of case histories focused on specific applications. The industry has lacked a compilation and comprehensive discussion of microseismic applications. This paper presents a practical guide for the engineering application of microseismic interpretations, documenting reliable application workflows while highlighting the consequences of misapplication of microseismic interpretations. The application of MSM starts with a reliable interpretation of fracture geometry and complexity, but the real value is in the application of the interpretation. This paper divides microseismic applications into three categories, real-time, completion strategies {\&} stimulation design, and field development. The MSM interpretation requirements for each category are documented and a comprehensive guide to properly applying these interpretations is presented. Applications issues such as determining the "effective?? fracture surface area, the relationship between microseismic behavior and well performance, and fracture model calibration are addressed. There is a growing interest in advanced processing such as moment tensor inversion (MTI) and b-values to determine focal mechanisms, source parameters, and failure mechanisms associated with the microseismic events. However, the engineering application of these interpretations is not well understood. This paper includes a discussion of the applications of advanced processing results, emphasizing how the limitations and uncertainties of the processing affect the subsequent applications.},

abstract = {Thousands of hydraulic fracture treatments have been monitored in the past ten years using microseismic mapping, providing a wealth of measurements that show a surprising degree of diversity in event patterns. Interpreting the microseismic data to determine the geometry and complexity of hydraulic fractures continues to be focused on visualization of the event patterns and qualitative estimates of the “stimulated volume”, which has led to wide variations and inconsistencies in interpretations. Comparing the energy input during a hydraulic fracture treatment and resultant energy released by microseismic events demonstrates that the seismic deformation is a very small portion of the total deformation. The vast majority of the energy is consumed in aseismic deformation (tensile opening) and fluid friction (Maxwell et al. 2008). Proper interpretation of microseismic measurements should account for both seismic and aseismic deformation, coupling the geomechanics of fracture opening and propagation with the shear failures that generate microseisms. Interpretation of microseismic measurements begins with an evaluation of location uncertainty, using signal-to-noise ratios and error ellipsoids, along with event moment magnitude. In some cases, microseismic event location uncertainty is erroneously interpreted as fracture complexity. The next step is to normalize the data and correct for observation well bias, both distance and azimuth, including use of seismic radiation patterns. Without these corrections fracture behavior from well to well or stage to stage (especially in horizontal wells) can easily be misinterpreted. Advanced geophysical processing that describes the failure mechanisms in more detail may also aid in the interpretation. The final step in the interpretation is to include the geomechanics of the overall process, accounting for the fracture treatment volumes injected, the net pressure in the hydraulic fracture(s) and the shear failures that generated the microseisms. This final, critical step is often overlooked when interpreting microseismic measurements. The paper provides a comprehensive, yet practical guide to the interpretation of microseismic measurements.},

abstract = {Frequency and time-domain analytical expressions are derived for the electromagnetic field response of a resistive layer inserted in an otherwise homogeneous whole-space as observed in the vicinity of an electric dipole source. The analysis of closed-form solutions demonstrated that at near-source-receiver offsets, the spectral and spatial distribution of the fields is better described by a superposition of images, associated with the dipolar character of the charges distributed in the boundaries, rather than the guided mode behavior dominating the response in the far offset regime. Approximate solutions of the fields in the frequency domain were derived using the saddle point method of integration. The formulas describing the fields were in good agreement with semianalytical calculations. However, a lower frequency bound was found, below which the expressions are inaccurate, and thereby they cannot be used to obtain time-domain solutions. A kernel modulation scheme was used instead, which yields an infinite series representation for the fields. The expressions thus derived produce accurate fields to very low frequencies, and thereby they were also used to obtain time-domain formulas. The analysis indicated that for a vertical electric dipole (VED) excitation, the late time response of the image field associated with the charge density induced on the upper boundary appears to cancel the direct field, thus providing the response of the layer. For a horizontal electric dipole (HED) source, the superimposed contributions of the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes appeared to oppose the image field, resulting in the direct field dominating over the response of the layer, and thereby masking any sensitivity to the properties of the layer in this configuration.},

abstract = {SummaryHydraulic fracturing is an important technique to allow mobilization of hydrocarbons in tight reservoirs. Sand or ceramic proppant is pumped into the fractured reservoir to ensure fractures remain open and permeable after the hydraulic treatment. As such, the distribution of proppant is a controlling factor on where the reservoir is permeable and can be effectively drained. Methods to monitor the fracturing process, such as tiltmeters or microseismic, are not sensitive to proppant distributions in the subsurface after the fracturing treatment is complete (Cipolla and Wright, 2000).An electrically conductive proppant could create a significant physical property contrast between the propped region of the reservoir and the host rock. Electromagnetic geophysical methods can be used to image this property (Heagy and Oldenburg, 2013). However, traditional geophysical inversions are poorly constrained, requiring a-priori information to be incorporated through known electrical properties. We examine a strategy to invert directly for the proppant volume using a parametrization of electrical conductivity in terms of proppant distribution within the reservoir.},

abstract = {Interpreting hydraulic fracture geometry isn't the only proven value application of microseismic imaging. With careful geophysical analysis, the microseismic deformation can also be determined in terms of the fracture strain that results in the source of the observed microseismic signals. The microseismic strain or deformation is potentially of interest, since the deformation associated with the hydraulic fracture controls the fracture dilation and complexity and ultimately the effectiveness of the stimulation. However, evidence is presented here which points to the microseismic being primarily a fast, shearing deformation in contrast to the relatively slow and tensile hydraulic fracture growth. Comparing the deformation energy balance between the recorded microseismic and the hydraulic fracture indicates that the microseismic is a very small component of total deformation. The majority of the fracture deformation is aseismic, beyond what is captured with conventional microseismic monitoring. The microseismic and hydraulic fracture deformations can be rationalized through a geomechanical model that honors the fracture mechanics and mass balance to simulate fracture growth. A workflow is presented that describes calibrating a geomechanical model using the location, timing and strains of the recorded microseismic to match the modeled interaction between the hydraulic fracture and pre-existing fractures. A rock physics model is also required to define synthetic microseismic data from the geomechanical model, for comparison with the observed microseismic data. The simplest form of calibration is a qualitative match between the relative microseismic density of either number of events or source strength. However, more advanced quantitative matches can also be made between the simulated and monitored microseismicity, by matching the microseismic displacements and mechanisms with the additional constraint of matching the energy balance. Through such a calibrated geomechanical model, the interrelation between stress, fractures, and injected fluid can be examined and used to characterize the hydraulic fracture growth. The validated hydraulic fracture model can then be incorporated into a reservoir simulator to ultimately predict the associated production characteristics. Therefore, beyond hydraulic fracture geometry, microseismic source deformation can be used to constrain a geomechanical model of the hydraulic fracture growth and thereby help describe the overall effectiveness of the stimulation.},

abstract = {Microseismic monitoring has been used to image hydraulic fracture growth in the Barnett Shale. The Barnett is a naturally fractured shale reservoir, which causes significant complexity in fracture growth during well stimulation operations. Several Barnett treatments have been successfully imaged between March 2000 and December 2001. In this paper, examples will be given to illustrate the complexity and variability which is developed during the treatment as the slurry interacts with the pre-existing fracture sets. The microseismic images explain why the stimulations occasionally grow at an angle to the assumed fracture orientation and into neighboring wells. Differences in production rates from various wells could also be related to the fracture geometry. The implications of the images to reservoir management highlight the benefit of imaging individual fracture networks to avoid overlapping and for targeting potential new well locations.},

@article{Alumbaugh1997,
abstract = {Summary A 3-D electromagnetic inversion scheme has been successfully applied to crosswell electromagnetic data collected at the Richmond Field Station near Berkeley, California. By comparing images of data collected before and after the injection of 50000 gallons of salt water, a 3-D image of the plume has been developed, which shows the location of zones of maximum permeability surrounding the injection well through which the salt water has migrated. A resolution analysis has determined that the location of the plume is fairly accurate. However, the image of the geology will be distorted due to incomplete data coverage. This latter problem is further complicated by the fact that data residuals indicate that the wells deviate from the vertical. These deviations have been shown to cause artefacts within the images and thus further reduce the accuracy of the images with respect to the geology.},
